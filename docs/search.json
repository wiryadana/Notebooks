Typical diet 70 mmol of potassium, while the recommended intake is 120 mmol per day. Gastrointestinal tract efficiently absorbs potassium.\n\n\nPotassium Distribution\nAfter absorption from the GI tract, potassium distributes rapidly into the extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF) compartments. Cellular potassium uptake is rapid and limits the magnitude of changes in serum potassium concentration. During potassium deficiency, shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular compartments limits the change in extracellular potassium concentration.\nMost potassium is in the ICF. Most body potassium is intracellular, with only 1% to 2% in the ECF. Potassium is the major intracellular cation, with cytosolic K+ concentrations about 100 to 120 mmol/L. Total intracellular K+ content is 3000 to 3500 mmol in healthy adults and is found primarily in muscle (70%), with a lesser amount in bone, red blood cells, liver, and skin.\n\n\nRenal Handling of Potassium in Normal Kidney\n\n\nRenal Potassium Handling in Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n\n\nHypokalemia\n\n\nHyperkalemia\n\n\n\nDisorders of Calcium, Phosphate and Magnesium Metabolism\n\n\nAcid-Base Balance\n\nMetabolic Acidosis\n\n\nMetabolic Alkalosis\n\n\nRespiratory Acidosis\n\n\nRespiratory Alkalosis\n\n\nMixed Acid Base Balance\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Infectious Disease in Kidney\n\n\n9.1.4 Acute Kidney Injury\n\n\n9.1.5 GLomerular Disease\n\n\n9.1.6 Tubulointerstitial Disease\n\n\n9.1.7 Diabetic Kidney Disease\n\n\n9.1.8 Renovascular Disease\n\n\n9.1.9 Hepatorenal Syndrome\n\n\n9.1.10 Cardiorenal Syndrome\n\n\n9.1.11 Pregnancy and Renal Disease\n\n\n9.1.12 Congenital Disease of the Kidney\n\n\n9.1.13 Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n\n9.1.14 Dialytic Therapy\n\n\n9.1.15 Transplantation\n\n\n9.1.16 Edema and Diuretics use\n\nDiuretics Type\nDiuretics are based on the sites of action. These are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: The proximal tubule (PT, purple segment) is represented by a typical PT cell. The loop of Henle (LH) includes a thick ascending limb (TAL, green segment), and a typical TAL cell is shown in green. The distal convoluted tubule (DCT, blue segment) is represented by a typical DCT cell in blue. The collecting duct (CD, yellow and orange segments) includes principal cells (PC), shown in yellow.\n\n\n\n\n\nProximal Tubular Diuretics\nCarbonic Anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) work by inhibiting generation of intracellular Hidrogen ion, which is a requirement for absorption of natrium. This is the main action for its diuretics property. Most of the work in proximal tubule where bulk of natrium absorption, although Na absorption in more distal tubule will reduce CAI effects. Acetazolamide is the only diuretics used in practice. Asetasolamide has short action, due to ready absorbed and easily eliminated by tubular action. Prolonged used will cause metabolic acidosis, thus acetazolamied 250 to 500 mg daily used to correct metabolic alkalosis as side effects of thiazide or loop diuretics. Its use shouldbe cautiously in advanced kidney disease as it will systemically accumulates with repeat dosing.\n\n\nDistal Convoluted Tubule Diuretics\nThe major site of action of thiazide diuretics is the early DCT where they inhibit the coupled reabsorption of Na+ and chloride (Cl−). Thiazides also :\n\ninhibit NaCl/fluid reabsorption in the medullary-collecting duct.\nThe water-soluble thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) also inhibit CA when given at high doses, and therein further increase Na+ excretion.\nthiazide diuretics impair urinary diluting capacity without affecting urinary concentrating mechanisms,\nreduce calcium (Ca++) and urate excretion,\nincrease magnesium (Mg++) excretion\nthiazide diuretic to minimize the development of loop diuretic–related DCT cell hypertrophy that might otherwise increase Na+ absorption\n\nThe onset of diuresis with hidrochlorotiazid (HCTZ) occurs within 2 hours, peaks between 3 and 6 hours, and dose-dependently continues for upward to 12 hours. The half-life (t 12) of HCTZ is prolonged both in decompensated HF and kidney failure. Doses of thiazide diuretics in the 100 to 200 mg/day range are required to initiate a diuresis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), although the overall natriuretic response is arbitrated by the GFR/filtered Na+ load.\nA newer thiazid diuretis are chlorthalidone. chlorthalidone and HCTZ are structurally similar, they differ pharmacokinetically in that chlorthalidone has a longer t 12 of 40 to 60 hours versus 3.2 to 13.1 hours for HCTZ, as well as a larger volume of distribution by virtue of its extensive partitioning into red blood cells. This latter feature creates a depot that promotes continuous streaming of chlorthalidone (red cell → plasma → tubular secretion). This plasma half-life dif-ference for chlorthalidone correlates with a more extended diuretic effect and is a likely explanation for the observation that chlorthalidone is a better mg-for-mg antihypertensive than HCTZ.\n\n\nLoop Diuretics\nLoop diuretics act predominantly at the luminal membrane in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle where they compete with Cl− for binding to the Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter, thereby inhibiting Na+ and Cl− reabsorption. Loop diuretics also:\n\na decrease in both free water (H2O) excretion and absorption during H2O loading and dehydration, respectively,\na 30% increase in fractional Ca++ excretion, a significant increase in Mg++ excretion,\nbrief increase followed by a more long-lived decrease in uric acid excretion.\nStimulate renal prostaglandin synthesis, particularly that of the vasodilatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).\n\nAngiotensin-II, generated following the administration of intravenous loop diuretics, coupled with an increased synthesis of PGE2, are the likely reasons for the shift in renal blood flow (RBF) from the inner to the outer renal cortex with these drugs; however, both total RBF and GFR are maintained when loop diuretics are administered to normal subjects. Loop diuretics are highly protein bound, therefore to gain access to their tubular site of action they must be secreted as is the case for thiazide diuretics. Tubular secretion of loop diuretics may be interfered by elevated levels of endogenous organic acids, as arise in CKD, and by drugs that share the same transporter site, such as salicylates and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Uremic toxins and fatty acids can decrease loop diuretic protein binding and further alter diuretic pharmacokinetics.\nFurosemide is the most widely used diuretic in this class; however, its use is complicated by variable absorption with a bioavailability ranging from 12% to 112%. The coefficient of variation for absorption varies from 25% to 43% for different furosemide products, and exchanging one furosemide. formulation for another will not standardize patient absorption and/or response to oral furosemide. Loop diuretics are commonly used in the patient with CKD, with the renal clearance of these drugs reduced in parallel with the degree of reduction in kidney function. In general, furosemide pharmacokinetics are more significantly changed in CKD than the other loop diuretics, with both its renal metabolism and intact clearance reduced in CKD.\n\n\nDistal Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\nThere are two classes of K+-sparing diuretics: competitive antagonists of aldosterone, such as spironolactone or eplerenone, and compounds that work independent of aldosterone, such as amiloride and triamterene. Drugs in this class reduce active Na+ absorption in the late DCT/collecting duct (CD). Basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase activity reduced, intracellular K+ concentration decreases, and the electrochemical gradient for K+ is lowered, thereby reducing K+ secretion. K+-sparing diuretics also reduce Ca++ and Mg++ excretion, which is a useful feature in the HF patient. Because K+-sparing diuretics are only modestly natriuretic, their clinical utility resides more in their K+-sparing capacity, particularly when more proximally acting diuretics increase distal Na+ delivery or in the instance of either primary or secondary aldosteronism.\nSpironolactone is a well-absorbed, highly protein-bound, lipid-soluble K+-sparing diuretic with a 20-hour half-life. The onset of action for spironolactone is characteristically slow, with a peak response at times 48-hours or more after the initial dose. Spironolactone, unlike amiloride and triamterene, remains active (as a diuretic and antihypertensive agent) in advanced kidney failure in that its locus of action is basolateral; thus it does not require glomerular filtration or tubular secretion to gain access to its effect site. Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that is highly selective for the aldosterone receptor; accordingly, its much lower affinity for androgen and progesterone receptors results in considerably less gynecomastia than is the case with spironolactone.\n\n\nOsmotic Diuretics\nMannitol is a polysaccharide diuretic given intravenously that is freely eliminated by glomerular filtration. Mannitol is poorly reabsorbed along the length of the nephron and thereby exerts a dose-dependent osmotic effect. This osmotic effect traps water and solutes in the tubular fluid, thus increasing Na+, K+, Cl−, and HCO3− excretion. The plasma half life mannitol depends on the level of kidney function but usually is between 30 and 60 minutes; thus its diuretic properties are quite transient. Mannitol has been used to reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, having rhabdomyolysis, or following exposure to contrast media. mannitol also expands extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and can precipitate pulmonary edema in patients with HF, it should be used cautiously, if at all, in these patients. excessive mannitol administration, particularly in the setting of a reduced GFR, can cause dilutional hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and/or AKI. The latter is dose dependent, relates to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, and commonly corrects with the elimination of excess mannitol as may be accomplished with hemodialysis.\n\n\nEdema Treatment\nThe pathophysiology of Na+ and H2O retention in the patient with edema is typically characterized by a complex interchange of hemodynamic and neurohumoral factors. For example, systemically perceived arterial underfilling sets into motion related Na+ and H2O retention in the patient with HF. In other instances, such as in the patient with a reduced GFR and/or nephrotic syndrome, Na+ and H2O retention derives from a more primary set of renal processes. There are two important considerations that should be brought to bear before and/or concurrent with initiation of diuretic therapy: the need to restrict dietary Na+ intake (2 to 4 g Na+ day) and dose reduction/elimination of drugs that foster Na+ retention, such as NSAIDs, nonspecific vasodilators like hydralazine and minoxidil, and high-dose β-blockers or central α-agonists.\nA compound, such as chlorthalidone, can be quite effective in the setting of mild to moderate edema given once or twice daily in the 25- to 50-mg/day range. When the underlying disease state worsens and/or dietary Na+ restriction cannot be adequately maintained, then conversion to a loop diuretic–based regimen becomes the more practiced approach. Combination diuretic therapy can be considered thereafter, either because the severity of the edema requires “sequential nephron blockade” or because the underlying disease state is particularly sensitive to medications other than loop diuretics, as is the case for spironolactone (50 → 400-mg/day range) use in the patient with advanced cases of cirrhosis and ascites.\nDetermining the minimally effective dose for a diuretic effect is a necessary clinical exercise, particularly in the patient with a reduced GFR. Gradually increasing a diuretic dose until a response is seen will establish the threshold/ effect dose, and thereafter the frequency of dosing can be established based on clinical circumstances. The beginning dose from which dose titration proceeds is influenced by both the level of kidney function and the severity of the edematous state. If kidney function is reduced, the diuretic dose-response curve shifts to the right and the maximal effectiveness, based on absolute Na+ excretion rate, can be significantly reduced, therein making dietary Na+ restriction of considerable importance. In CKD patients with edema furosemid 40 mg twice daily would be considered adequate starting doses that could then be gradually incremented until the desired effect is achieved. Often, the dose that elicits an increase in urine output can be continued indefinitely unless the underlying disease state worsens and/or dietary Na+ intake becomes inordinately high. Conversely, a diuretic dose that establishes “euvolemia” can occasionally be lowered and restriction of dietary Na+ intake given added opportunity to minimize edema redevelopment. Diuretic dose reduction should always be a sought after consideration, as it minimizes loss of K+, Mg++, and, in the case of loop diuretics, Ca++.\n\nAdaptation to Diuretic Therapy\nDiuretic-induced inhibition of Na+ reabsorption in one nephron segment elicits important adaptations in other nephron segments, which not only limits their antihypertensive and fluid-depleting actions but also contributes to the development of side effects. The initial dose of a diuretic normally produces a brisk diuresis, which is quickly followed by a new equilibrium state in which daily fluid and electrolyte excretion either matches or is less than intake with body weight stabilizing. In nonedematous patients given either a thiazide or a loop diuretic, this adaptation, or braking phenomenon, occurs within 1 to 2 days and limits net weight loss to 1 to 2 kg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Effect of a loop diuretic on urinary sodium (Na ) excretion. Each bar represents a 6-hour time interval. Purple bars indicate periods during which urinary Na+ excretion (UNaV) exceeds that of dietary intake. Blue areas indicate periods of postdiuretic Na+ retention, during which dietary Na+ intake exceeds urinary Na+ excretion. The horizontal black line indicates dietary Na+ intake per 24-hour period. Changes in the magnitude of the natriuretic response over several days are reflective of the “braking phenomenon.” Inset shows the effect of diuretics on weight (and extracellular fluid volume) during several days of diuretic administration.\n\n\n\nFor example, furosemide administered orally to subjects ingesting a high-Na+ diet (270 mmol/24 hours) produced an initial brisk natriuresis, which resulted in a negative Na+ balance over the ensuing 6 hours. This was followed by an 18-hour period when Na+ excretion was reduced to levels well below the prescribed Na+ intake, resulting in a positive Na+ balance. This postdiuresis Na+ retention matched the initial natriuresis with the result at the end of the day being a neutral Na+ balance state and no weight loss. After 3 successive days of furosemide administration, a similar pattern of Na+ loss and retention was demonstrated each day. if Na+ intake is kept very low, balance can remain negative after a single dose of furosemide, even though there is some blunting of the initial natriuretic response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: (A) Comparison of effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and conditions marked by edema on the loop diuretic dose response, expressed as fractional Na+ excretion (FENa). Diuretic delivery via secretion into the lumen is impaired in CKD (pharmacokinetic abnormal- ity), whereas the response to delivered drug is diminished with edema (pharmacodynamic defect). (B) Effect of CKD on the absolute response to a loop diuretic. Compare with panel A. (C) Pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral loop diuretics. The diuretic thresholds for normal and edematous individuals are shown as horizontal lines; whereas a normal individual responds appropriately to either an intravenous or oral diuretic, some edematous individuals can only reach threshold excretion with intravenous diuretic administration.\n\n\n\nThe mechanistic basis for the braking phenomenon is complex. The relationship between natriuresis and the rate of furosemide excretion is shifted to the right in subjects receiving a low-salt diet, which denotes a blunting of tubular response. It appears to be unrelated to aldosterone, as spironolactone therapy has little effect on the Na+ retention. Structural hypertrophy in the distal nephron also occurs in rats receiving prolonged infusions of loop diuretics. These structural changes are marked by increased distal nephron Na+ and Cl− absorption and K+ secretion, phenomena which are aldosterone independent. These structural adaptationsmay contribute to postdiuretic Na+ retention and to diuretic tolerance in humans, and could explain the Na+ retention persisting for up to 2 weeks after loop diuretic therapy is discontinued.\nPlasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentrations rise within minutes of receiving an intravenous diuretic, a transient process that is independent of volume loss and/or sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. This rise in PRA is caused by inhibition of NaCl reabsorption at themacula densa in conjunction with loop-diuretic stimulation of renal prostaglandin release. Shortly after this initial rise in PRA, diuretics cause a more sustained increase in PRA and aldosterone arising from an increase in SNS activity (β-agonism) anda fall in ECF volume. The increase in renal prostaglandin production is the likely explanation for the preload reduction and decrease in ventricular filling pressures that occur within 15 minutes of loop diuretic administration.",

The resulting hypoperfusion followed by tissue hypoxia with accompanying lactic acidosis. Clinical Indicator:\n\nReduced MAP\nTachycardia\nTachypnea\nCool Skin and Extremities\nAcute Altered mental Status\nOliguria\n\nReduced MAP could be the product of decreased cardiac output and/or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Thus every shock patients should be evaluated for adequacy of cardiac output. Sign of diminished cardiac output includes (Cold Shock):\n\nA narrow pulse preassure (SBP - DBP), marker of stroke volume\nCool extremities and delayed capillary refill time (COLD SHOCK). Palpate proximal extremities (eg Thigh) rather than distal extremities to determine relative “coolness” as peripheral artery disease may always have cool distal extremities.\n\nContrary, there are sign of increased cardiac output (Warm Shock), that may results from decreased SVR:\n\nA widened pulse pressure (particularly reduced DBP)\nWarm extremities with bounding pulse,\nRapid capillary refill time\n\nIf reduced cardiac output found, then conduct assesment of volume status.\n\nHistory suggesting fluid loss or hemmorhage\nReduced JVP\nStraight leg raise or fluid challange\nUSG Marker: inferior vena cava collapse, left ventricular stroke volume\n\nreduced cardiac function with increased intravascular volume - S3 or S4 gallop - JVP increased - Extremity Edema - Crackles on lung auscultation - Chest Xray show cardiomegaly, widening vascular pedicle, kerley B lines, pulmonary edema. - ECG: ischemic with or withour chest pain.\nIf sign of increased cardiac output found, conduct search for cause of reduced SVR.\n\nSepsis\nLiver Failure\nSevere Pancreatitis\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nBurns\nTrauma\nAnaphylaxis\nThyrotoxicosis\nPeripheral AV shunts\n\nThe need for arterial line and CVC - if shock prolonged and doest resolve with proper fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agent.\nInitial evaluation followed with early aggresive targeted resuscitation improve survival.

Early intubation or mechanical ventilation often required for two main reasons:\n\nAcute hypoxemic respiratory failure.\n\nIt may occurs in cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema, septic shock with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nVentilatory failure\n\nOften occurs as a consquence of an increased load on the respiratory system in the form of acute metabolic acidosis or decreased lung compliance.\nAlso in shock, a large percentage of CO need for respiratory muscle (10 folds), lactic acid production from inefficient respiratory muscle activity presents an additional ventilatory load.

Therefore, fluid administration and vasopressor support might needed before intubation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Approach to Shock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Respiratory Failure\nRespiratory failure mechanistically on the basis of pathophysiology can be categorized onto:\n\nType 1: Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\nIt occurs due to alveolar flooding, subsquent Ventilation-perfusion (VP) mismatch and intrapulmonary shunt physiology.\nAlveolar flooding occurs due:\n\npulmonary edema, pulmonary edema further caused by:\n\nelevated pulmonary microvascular pressures (heart failure or fluid overload) or\nARDS (low pressure pulmonary edema), defined as: acute onset (\\(\\le\\) 1 week) of bilateral opacities on chest imaging that are not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload and ventilation perfusion mismatch, and shunt physiology that require positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)\n\nlung injury\npneumonia\nalveolar hemorrhage\n\nType 1 RF occurs in sepsis, gastric aspiration, pneumonia, covid-19, near drowning, multiple blood transfusion & pancreatitis.\n\nGeneral Treatment\n\nMechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume (12 ml/kg ideal body weight) traditionally further injured the lung due to repeated alveoli overdistention and stretching. This is called ventilator induced volutrauma and even induce ARDS in patients without ARDS initialy. many studies point toward low tidal volume (6 ml/kg ideal body weight) improve survival.\nreproduce Figure of Preassure volume relathionsip!!!\nProne positioning\nLow CVP or low PCWP or fluid conservatice approach fluid conservative management to maintain low CVP or PCWP associated with fewer days with mechanical ventilation than fluid liberal approach in patients that who have been resuscitated from shock.\n\n\n\n\nType 2 Respiratory Failure: Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure\nIt is a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation and the results from inability to eliminate CO2 effectively. The cause categorized into:\n\nimpaired CNS drive to breathe (“wont breathe”) Cause: drug overdose, brainstem injury, sleep-disordered breathing, severe hypothyroidism\nreduced strength or impaired neuromuscular function in respiratory systems (“cant breathe”) cause: impaired neuromuscular transmission (eg. myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or respiratory muscle weakness (eg. myopathy, electrolye problem, fatigue)\nincreased load on respiratory system (“cant breathe”) cause:\n\nincreased resistive load eg. brochospasm\nreduced lung compliance eg. alveolar edema, atelectasis, intrinsip PEEP\nreduced chest wall compliance eg. pneumothorax, pleural effusion, abdominal distention\nincreased minute ventilation requirements eg. pulmoanry embolus with increased dead space fraction, sepsis\n\n\n\ngeneral Treatment\nPrincipal: reversing the underlying cause(s). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with positive pressure ventilation with tight fitting mask or nasal mask (avoidance of intubation) may stabilize these patients. It tested extensively in exacerbation of COPD. Contraindication for NIV include hemodynamic instability, inability to protect airway, respiratory arrests, significant airway secretions, significant aspiration risk.\n\n\n\nType 3 Respiratory Failure: Lung Atelectasis\nThe primary cause is lung atelectasis. It is common in perioperaticve period, this form is also called perioperative respiratory failure. Post general anesthesia, there are decrease in functional residual capacity lead to collapse of dependent lung units.\n\ngeneral treatment\ntreatment include: frequent positional changes, chest physiotherapy, upright positioning, control of incisional/or abdominal pain.\n\n\n\nType 4 Respiratory Failure: Metabolic Demands\nMost often due to hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles in patients in shock. Normally, respiratory muscle consume &lt; 5% total cardiac outpur (CO) and oxygen delivery. Patients in shock oftern experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (eg. in cardiogenic shock), lactic acidosis and anemia. In these conditions, up to 40% CO distributed to respiratory muscle.\n\nGeneral Treatment\nEndotrachea intubation & mechanical ventilation allow blood redistributed to vital organ and reverse the underlying cause.\n\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation\nmechanical ventialtion is used to assist or replace sponstaneus breathung. Its application of high oxygen content + positive pressure. Primary indication is acute respiratory failure which there are two basic types: 1. hypoxemic and 2. hypercarbic. Hypoexemic present when arterial O2 saturation &lt;90% despite increased inspired O2 fraction due to ventilation perfusion mismatch or shunting. Hypercarbic characterized by elevated arterial CO2 (usually &gt;50 mmHg) resulting from conditions that decrease minute ventilation or increased physiologic dead space.\n\nTypes of Mechanical Ventilation\nthere are two types of MV: noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive (conventional MV)\n\nNoninvasive ventilation\nNIV: effective in acute and chronic respiratory failure with fewer complication (pneumonia & tracheolaringeal trauma). NIV provided by tight fitting mask, a nasal mask similar to taht used for sleep apnea. It is especially effective in COPD. Modes used are bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or pressure support ventilation (PSV). Both used positive pressure during inspiration and expiration, althouhg lower in expiration. Trial showed: COPD exacerbation ph 7,25 - 7,35 associated with good outcomes, for ph &lt;7,25 the failure increase with decreasing ph. patient with ph &gt;7,35 NIV is not better than conventional treatment (controlled O2, systemic glucocorticoid, bronchodilator and antibiotics).\nTHe used of NIV in other respiratory failure is limited, and in some conditions contraindicated (cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, decreased consciousness, GI bleeding, hemodynamic instability, MI, facial trauma, upper airway obstruction, inability to clear secretion), and may delay life saving measure. Reduced respiratory rate, decreased the use of accesory muscle (scalene, sternomastoid and intercostal) are good clinical indicator of improvement. ABG should be evaluated hours after NIV initiation, if no improvement it may need a conventional MV\n\n\nInvasive Ventilation (Conventional MV)\nIntubation (cuffed tibed inserted to trachea) to allow conditioned (warmed, oxygenated, humidified) gas delivered to the airways.\nPrinciples of MV: optimize oxygenation while avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury due to overstretch and collapse/re-recruitment (protective ventilatory strategy)\n\n\n\nModes of Ventilation\nmodes are the manner in which breaths are triggered, cycled and limited. - trigger: inspiratory effort or time based signal - cycle : refers to the factors that determine the end of inspiration (volume, pressure and time cycling) - limiting factors are operator-specified values: airway pressure.\nMost patient ventilated with assist-control, intermittent mandatory ventilation, PSV.\n\nAssist control ventilation\nAssist control (ACMV) is the most widely used. Used in initiation of MV. trigger: initiated by patient inspiratory effort, if none detected, by specified time signal. cycle: pressure or volume cycle. limit: specified tidal-volume, RR defined by patients rate or backup rate.\nproblem: auto-peep might occurs if dynamic hyperinflation due to high RR happens.\n\n\nIntermittent Mandatory Ventilation\nMost commmon modes: SIMV trigger: set mandatory breath, between each mandatory breath patient can breath spontaneously. in SIMV, mandatory breath delivered in syncrony with patients breath.if patient fail to initiate a breath, the machine give fixed volume and reset its timer for next breath. cycle: defined volume, limit:\ndifference with ACMV: only the a preset number of breath are ventilator-assisted. SIMV allowd patients with intact respiratory drive to exercise inspiratory msucles between assisted breath, useful for supporting and weaning intubation. problem: difficult to use in tacypnea, due to expiration attemp during ventilator inspiratory cycle. The pressure increase, and may abort the inspiration and thus lower tidal volume. In contrast, for tachypnea represent of metabocl or respiratory acidosis, change in ACMV will increase minute ventilation and help normalize pH\n\n\nPressure-support Ventilation\ntrigger: patient breath cycle: flow, isnpiration is terminated when airflow fall below a certain level. limit: pressure\nprovides graded asistence and differs from the other two in that the operator set the pressure level to augment every spontaneous breath. The level of pressure is adjusted by observing the patiens RR.\n\n\nPressure-Control Ventilation (PCV)\nuseful to limit peak pressure, in patients with preexisting barotreauma or post htoracic surgery.\ntrigger: time cycle: time, limit: pressure\nminute ventilation is altered through RR and pressure control.\n\n\nContinous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)\nAll ventilation occurs through the patients spontaneus efforts.

At the end of inspiration, there are transient pause of inspiratory flow, the pressure called plateu pressure. Plateu pressure determined by respiratory system compliance. During volume controlled ventilation, the difference peak airway pressure (airway + respiratory system) and plateu pressure (respiratory system) provides a quantitative assesment of airway resistance. Patients with increased airway resistence typically have increased peak airway pressures and abnormally high gradients between peak and plateu airway pressure (&gt; 10 - 15 cmH2O) at a constant inspiratory flow rate of 1 L/s(shown in figure Figure 2.2. Normally, respiratory system compliance is ~ 100 ml/cmH2O, divided by the lungs and chest wall. Pathophysiologic process decrease wall compliance such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax & increase abdominal girth. Lung compliance decreased by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhae, interstitial lung disease, or auto PEEP. Auto-PEEP occurs when there is insufficient time for emptying of alveoli before the next inspiratory cycle, thus alveoli failed to decompress fully and remains positive pressure at all phase of respiration. Theis phenomenon results most commonly from obstruction of distal airways such as Asthma or COPD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Graph Illustration taken from harrison\n\n\n\nPatients frequently require sedatives & analgetics.\n\nAnalgesics\nOpieates is the mainstay of mechanicaly ventilated patients\n\n\nSedatives\nAfter pain adequately controlled, sedation needed for anxiolysis, treatment of subjective dyspnea, reduction of autonomic hyperactiviy, reduction of total O2 consumption.

If reintubation is deemed difficult if required, evaluation with cuff-leak test is supported by evidence. If possibility of post-extubation stridor, administration of systemic steoroid should be given.\n\n\n\nProlonged MV and Tracheostomy\n5-13 % patients with MV will go on to require prolonged MV (&gt;21 days). It is important to decide whether and when to perform a trachoestomy. Tracheostomy is though to be more comfortable, require less sedation, and provide a more secure airway and reduce weaning time.\nIn general, if a need of MV for &gt;10-14 days, a tracheostomy would be indicated.\n\nMaintenance for mechanical Ventilated patients\nRespiratory System Mechanics\nPeak airway pressure dtermined by two variable: airway resistance and respiratory system compliance.

It may be direct (on the lung) or indirect (extrapulmoner including thoracic structure). The most case (&gt;80%) are caused by pneumonia and sepsis. Then, gastric aspiration, trauma, multiple transfusiion, pancreatitis, and drug overdose. Traumatic cause include pulmonary contusion, multiple bone fractures, chest trauma/flail chest. The risk increase with predisposing medical condition.\n\n\nPathophysiology\nNatural history of ARDS divided into 3 phases - exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic.\n\nExudative Phase\nThis phase encompases the first 7 days after precipitating ARDS risk factor. The alveolar capillary endhotelial cells and type 1 pneumocytes injured, loss of tight alveolar barrier to fluid and macromolecules. Edema fluid contain protein accumulates in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Proinflamatory cytokines increase followed by leukocytes recruitment. The leaked plasma condensed and agrreagte in the air spaces + cellular debris + dysfunctional surfactant to form hyaline membran whorls.\nAlveolar edema predominantly involves dependent portions of the lung with diminished aeration. Large lung dimineshed aeration cause increase in lung compliance. Alteration in alveolar spaces are exacerbated by microvascular occlusion leading to reduced perfusion and pulmonary hypertension. it also cause intrapulmonary shunting and hypoxemia, leading to dyspnea.\nsign: - dyspnea, may leads to respiratory fatigue - chest radiograph reveals opacities resembling pulmonary edema. distinguishing featues from cardiogenic pulmonary edema are no cardiomegaly, no pleural effusin, or no pulmonary vascular redistribution. - laboratory finding indicative of the underlying disoder.\n\n\nProliferative Phase\nphase day 7 to 21. May showed an improvement, including weaning of mechanical ventilation. It may shows some degree of lung repair, reduced alveolar exudates, and shift to lymphocytes predominant infiltrat, increased surfactant.\nsign: - improvement in symtoms, but still dyspnea - tachypnea - hypoxemia\n\n\nFibrotic Phase\nPhase 3-4 weeks after lung injury. Many patients may recover, but some enter a fibrotic phase. The exudate convert to extensive alveolar duct and interstitial fibrosis. desctruction of acinar architecture leads to emphysema like changes (bullae), and may also develop microvascular occlusion and pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\nGeneral Principles\nEmphasize on treatment of the Critical ill\n\ntreatment of underlying cause\nminimization of unnecessary procedures\nstandardized bundle care\npromt recognition of nosocomial infections\nadequte nutrition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: ARDS Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation\nPatient meeting criteria ARDS frequently become respiratory fatigues, so it requires mechanical ventilation.\n\nMinimize ventilator induced lung injury\nMechanical ventilatio (MV) can save lifes, but also can aggravate lung injury due to volutrauma and atelectrauma. Volutrauma can occurs due to overdistention of alveoli due to effort to inflate the consolited lungs thus damaging the still functioning alveoli.\n\nLow tidal volume 6ml/kg predicted body weight are better than coenventional 12 ml/kg bodyweight.\nlower airway pressure, plateu pressure \\(\\le\\) 30 cm H2O.\nRR \\(\\le\\) 35\n\n\n\nMinimize atelectrauma\nIn presence of fluid and loss of surfactant, PEEP is required to prevent atelectasis. PEEP is adjusted to minimize FIO2 while able to provide adequate PaO2 without causing alveolar overdistention. Follow table of PEEP-FiO2 combinations from ARDS Network trial.\nother technique includes recruitment manuever, that transiently increase PEEP to high levels to recruit ateletatic lung can increase oxygenation, but a mortality benefit has not been established.\n\n\nProne positioning\nIt improves survival.\n\n\n\nFluid Management\nincreased pulmonary vascular permeability leading to interstitial and alveolar edema fluid rich in protein is a centra features of ARDS. impaired vascular integrity augments the normal increase in extravascular lung water. Thus keeping low left atrial filling pressure could minimize pulmonary edema. Fluid restriction and diuretics should be an important aspect of ARDS management, limited only by hypotension and hypoperfusion.\n\n\nNeuromuscular blockage\nSedation alone may not adequate for ventilator syncrony. Selective use of neuromuscular blockage for ventilator syncrony could improves survival.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids\nCurrent evidence does not support the routine use of glucocorticoids.\n\n\n\nPrognosis\nextrapulmonary organ failures and sepsis counts &gt; 80% of deaths. Risk factor for reduced survival are age (&gt;60 yo), preexistin organ dysfunction. Patients who survives despite prolonged respiratory failures and dependent on MV may recover within 6 months.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Approach to Circulatory Shock\nshock is the clinical condition of organ dysfuntion resulting from imbalance between celular oxygen supply and demand. Shock is reversible in early state, but if left untreated leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death.\n\nPathophysiology of Shock\nThe cellular oxygen imbalance most commonly related to impaired oxygen delivery in the setting circulatory failure. - shock may also occurs in the setting of failure oxygen utilization (cyanide poisoning) - and state of increased oxygen demand.\nIn the setting of inadequate oxygen supply, the cell cannot maintain aerobic metabolism, thus forced into anaerobic metabolism and produce lactate and less ATP. Less ATP supply impaired cell ability to maintain hemeostasis such as maintaining N/K pump. Celular pump failure cause influx of calcium and leads to activation of phospolipases and protease, causing cellular swelling and death. In addition, hypoxia cause leakage of intracellular contents to the extracellular space, activating inflamatory cascasdes.\nOxygen delivery influenced by two major components, namely Cardiac Output (CO) and arterial oxygen content (CaO2.\nDO2 = CO x CaO2, major determinants of CO are HR and SV\nDO2 = (HR x SV) x CaO2, major determinants of SV are preload, afterload (SVR), and cardiac contractility. thus\nSV ~ (Preload x Contractility)/SVR\nPreload refees to myocardical fibers lenght before contraction (LV-EDV). Contractility refers to the ability of the ventricile to contract independent of preload and afterload. SVR represent afterload, force that ventricle must overcome to send the blood out of the cardiac cambers.\nThe CaO2 is composed of oxygen carried by convection with hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in blood,\nCaO2 = (Kg x 1,39 x SaO2) + (PaO2 x 0,03)\nA disease process that affects these variables (HR, preload, contractility, SVR, SaO2, or Hb) has potential to reduce DO2.\n\n\nClassification of Shock\nFour major shock types are distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and obstrictive. Each has unique hemodynamics profile.\n\nDistributive Shock\nDistributive shock is condition of reduced O2 delivery where the primary physiologic distubance is reduction in SVR. There are increase of CO as a compensatory effort. CVP and PCWP reduced. The most common etiology is sepsis. Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to infection. If accompanied by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and needed vasopressor support, it is called septic shock. Other medical cause : Anaphylaxis (IgE mediated vasodilatation after exposure to allergen), pancreatitis, severe burns, liver failure. There almost 35% extravasation of circulating blood volume within 10 minutes. Patiens with severe brain or spinal cord injury may have a reduction in SVR due to disruption of autonomic pathways and blood pooling in venous system. Other cause is adrenal insuficiency due to chronic steroid use, medication , malignancy, adrenal hemmorhage, infection or autoimune. Acute stress condition, created deficit in steroid, and cause vasodilatation as well as aldosteron deficiency-mediated hypovolemia.\n\n\nCardiogenic Shock\nCardiogenic shock is characterized by reduced O2 delivery related to a reduction in CO owing to a primary cardiac problem. There are compensatory response as an increase in SVR. If left ventricle is dysfunction, there will be increased PCWP, and if right ventricle is will present as increased CVP. SV may reduced due to reduced contractility (MI, Cardiomyopathies, myocarditis), valvular disease, or due to alteration in HR (bradiaritmia and tachyarithmia)\n\n\nHypovolemic Shock\nHypovolemic shock encompasses disease that reduce CO and DO2 via a reduction in preload. There is elevation is SVR and low CVP-PCWP. Most common cause is hemmorhage followed by fluid loss from diarhea or vomiting, diuresis, skin damage.\n\n\nObstructive Shock\nObstructive shock is reduced O2 delivery related to reduced CO because impairment in blood flow, both inflow and outflow, in extracardiac pulmonary vascular or other mechanical process. Inflow obstruction Etiology: tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, restrictive pericarditis. Outflow obstruction etiology: pulmonary embolism, venous air embolis, fat embolism or aortic dissection.\nUGD =&gt; hypovolemic (30,8%) &gt; septic (27,2%) &gt; distributive non septic (23,4%) &gt; cardiogenic (14%) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obstructiove shock (0,9%). ICU =&gt; Shock predominates )62%) &gt;&gt; Hypovolemic (16%) ~ cardiogenic shock (15%) &gt;&gt;&gt; obstructive shock (2%).\nMortality rate: cardiogenic ~ septic &gt; hypovolemic\n\n\n\nStages of Shock\nThere are 3, preshock, shock and irreversible shock. Body utilize variety of physiologic response to counter initial insult. There no overt sign of organ dysfunction. Lab: slight elevation of creatine or troponin or mild elevation of lactate. If host compensatory mechanism are not enough, organ dysfuction occurs and irreversible Shock ensued.\n\n\nEvaluation of the patient with Shock\nearly recongition is paramount important to reverse the stages of shock. Anamnesis to find the cause. Physical examination to identify circulatory failure (hypotension SBP &lt;90 mmHG, or MAP &lt; 65 mmHg) and sign of organ dysfunction. Check urine output. Finding: High CO shock: warm peripherals, CRT &lt;2 S, large pulse pressure (LOW DBP). Low CO shock: delayed CRT, cool extremities, weak pulses.\nIncreased instravasular filling pressure and JVP (cardiogenic, obstrctive shock)\nShock Index : defined as the HR/SBP with normal SI 0,5 - 0,7\nLab test: - Lactate - Renal function - liver function - cardiac enzymes - CBC - Hemostatic index - UL - PP test if needed - ECG - CXR - POCUS (RUSH, ACES, SESAME protocol)\n\n\nInitial Treatment of Shock\n\nInitiate treatment for circulatory shock.\nFind venous access and invasive monitoring if needed\n\n\nVolume Resuscitation\nThe physiologic goal of volume resuscitation is to move the patient to the nonpreload-dependent portion of the Starling curve. Most patients with any of the four shock types will benefit from an increase in intra-vascular volume. suspected septic shock, a minimum of 30 mL/kg is recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. While the need for volume resuscitation is most apparent for patients with distributive or hypovolemic shock, even patients with cardiogenic shock may benefit from cautious volume replacement. In these patients, there should be a careful assessment of volume status prior to volume administration.\nVolume resuscitation will begin with crystalloid. In patients with hypovolemic shock due to ongoing hemorrhage, volume replacement with packed red blood cells is warranted. In cases of massive transfusion, platelets and fresh frozen plasma should be provided to offset the dilution of these components during volume replacement. Because hemoglobin is a key determinant of CaCO2, red cell administration may be a part of volume replacement even without hemorrhage in order to optimize oxygen delivery if hemoglobin content is &lt;7 g/dL.\nAssessment of intravascular volume status (and the adequacy of volume resuscitation) begins with the physical examination. The passive leg raise (PLR) test can predict responsiveness to additional intravenous fluid (IVF) by providing the patient with an endogenous volume bolus. While the patient is resting in a semirecumbent position at a 45° angle, the bed is placed in Trendelenburg position such that the patient’s head becomes horizontal and the legs are extended at a 45° angle. There is then an immediate (within 1 min) assessment of changes in CO (or pulse pressure variation as a surrogate). It is important to emphasize that one does not merely look for changes in blood pressure; if the shock patient is mechanically ventilated there is the option of looking at changes in SV variation (or pulse pressure variation) during the respiratory cycle to assess volume responsiveness. A &gt;12% SV variation suggests a volume-responsive state. This measurement requires that the patient be in a volume cycle mode of ventilation, without breath-to-breath variations in intrathoracic pressure and without arrhythmias.\nThere is also increased use of echocardiography to assist in determination of intravascular fluid status, with a variety of static and dynamic variables The most commonly used parameters to assess adequacy of volume resuscitation are inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and IVC collapse. Alternatively, serial assessments of LV function can be performed while volume is being administered. Placement of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is another tool for assessment of volume status. This more invasive measure involves placement of the PAC into the central venous circulation and through the right heart. Ports in the PAC (Swan-Ganz catheter) allow for direct measurement of CVP, pulmonary artery (PA), and PCWPs. The PCWP is used as a surrogate for LA pressure.\n\n\nVasopresor and Inotropic Support\nIf hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion persist, then vasopressor and inotropic support should be initiated. The use of vasopressors and inotropes must be tailored to the primary physiologic disturbance.\nIn distributive shock, the aim is to increase the SVR. Norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor, with potent α1 and β1 adrenergic effects. The α1 causes vasoconstriction while β1 has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. At high doses, epinephrine has a similar profile (at lower doses the β effects predominate) but is associated with tachyarrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, decreased splanchnic blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, and acidosis. In distributive shock, vasopressin deficiency may be present. Vasopressin acts on the vasopressin receptor to reverse vasodilation and redistribute flow to the splanchnic circulation. Dopamine does not have a role as a first-line agent in distributive shock.\nFor patients with cardiogenic shock, dobutamine is the first-line agent; it is a synthetic catecholamine with primarily β-mediated effects and minimal α adrenergic effects. The β1 effect is manifest in increased inotropy and the β2 effect leads to vasodilation with decreased afterload; it can be used with norepinephrine in patients with mixed distributive and cardiogenic shock.\n\n\nOxygenation and Ventilation Support\nSupplemental oxygen should be initiated and titrated to maintain SpO2 of 92–95%. patients may require intuvation and MV for two reason:\n\nprimary pulmonary process or related to LV dysfunction and elevations of PCWP. For patients with all types of shock, there can be development of ARDS and subsequent V/Q mismatch and shunt.\nhigh minute ventilatory needs to compensate for metabolic acidosis. As shock progresses, they may not be able to maintain adequate respiratory compensation.\n\nIt is important to provide ventilation with lung-protective strategies focused on low tidal volume ventilation and optimization of positive end-expiratory pressure to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury.\n\n\nAntibiotics\nFor patients presenting with undifferentiated shock, if the diagnosis of septic shock is being entertained, then broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered after obtaining appropriate cultures. While it is ideal to initiate antibiotics after appropriate cultures, the inability to obtain cultures should not delay the start of treatment\n\n\nOther specific treatment for specific etiology\nThe initial evaluation (history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing) may have identified an etiology of shock that requires urgent lifesaving intervention in addition to the initial treatment steps out- lined above.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Sepsis\n\n\n2.2.6 Cardiogenic Shock and Pulmonary edema\n\n\n2.2.7 Cardiac Arrest\n\n\n2.2.8 Neurological Critical illness",

Parameter derived from calculation: HCT, MCH, MCHC\n\nMeasurement of RBC count and hematocrite\nHCT are measured from RBC x MCV/10, falsely elevated MCV and decreased RBC can be observed when red cell autoantibodies are presents and binding capability at room temperature, thus creatig red cell clumping.\n\n\nMeasurement of Hemoglobin\nRBC contain mixture of HB, including: oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and other minor hemoglobin. HB quantification done lysing the cell and converted the all HB variants to cyanmethemoglobin for quantification by absorptio at 540 mm. Major interference with this method is the present of chylomicronemia.\n\n\nStandard Red Cell Indices\nMean Cell Volume\nMean cell volume (MCV) are measured directly by electrical impendance or light scattering.\nMean Cell Hemoglobin\nMean cell hemoglobin (MCH) is the amount of HB per red cell. It is derived from Hemoglobin content and red cell count, two most accurate measurement, thus could provide consistent result among many type of analyzer. Reduced cell hemogobin is paralel to the reduced MCV. Mean cell hemoglobin concentration is not used much for diagnostic, it is primarily ised for quality control purpose.\nRed Cell Distribution Width\nRed cell distribution widht or RDW is an estimate of volume variability in red cells population. RDW expressed as 1 SD of red cell volume measurements divided by the MCV.RDW has developed as biomarker for various clinical condition and may be a surrogate of systemic inflamation\nReticulocyte Count & RNA Content\nReticulocyte is a newly released anuclete red cell that enters bloodstream with residual but detectable RNA. The Reticulocyte counts permits an estimate of marrow erythrocyte production, thus provide tools for evaluation anemia due to inadequate production or accelerated destruction. Reticulocytes are now measured by exposig the samples with Fluoresced, RNA binding Dyes. Measurement are reported in abosolute counts, reticulosytes per microliter of Blood, obviating the need to corrrect for reduced red cell counts in anemia.\nThe measuremet of Reticulocytes specific hemoglobin content (CHr and RET-He) are closely related to iron availability withiin 24-48 hours, and is very usefull in detecting functional iron deficiency in complex clinical situation such as chronic inflamation or chronic kidney disease. Reticulocytes specific hemoglobin are superior to traditional iron parameter due to feritin also acts as a acute phase reactants.\nOther Indices\nNucleated red cells: are presents in newborns, physiologicaly stress individual and variety disorders such as hypoxic states, severe hemolytics anemia, primary myelofibrosis, infiltrative disease of the marrow.\n\n\nLeukocyte Counts and Differetial\n\n\n\nQualitative Parameter\n\n\n\nExamination of Marrow Cells\nBone marrow aspiration was devised by Arinkin in 1923, then the egular use posterior illiac crest for aspiration and biopsy occured in 1970.",

The term “hem-orrhoids” is also applied to situations when these cushions become symptomatic.\nHemorrhoids are the result of slippage of the anal cushions due to weakening of the supporting tissues. The prolapse hinders the venous ﬂow leading to dilatation and engorge-ment of the anal cushions, exposing them to complications such as edema, thrombosis, and bleeding.\nHemorrhoids are classiﬁed as internal, external, or combined. Internal hemorrhoids are located proximal to the dentate line and are covered by insensate columnar mucosa or transitional epithelium. External hemorrhoids are located below the dentate line, covered with squamous epithelium rich in nerve endings.\n\nClinical Presentation\nThe most common clinical presentation are;\n\nBleeding per rectum.\nProlapsing tissue.\n\nBleeding per rectum is The bleeding is bright red and painless, and it usually follows evacuation.\nProlapse occurs during straining or heavy lifting causing dis-comfort, feeling of incomplete evacuation, mucus discharge, and pruritus. Prolapsing hemorrhoids can be complicated by incarceration and strangulation secondary to thrombosis, causing severe pain and requiring urgent surgery.\nInternal hemorrhoids are classiﬁed according to the degree of prolapse:\n\nGrade I – bleeding without prolapse;\nGrade II – prolapse on straining that spontaneously reduces;\nGrade III – prolapse that requires manual reduction; and\nGrade IV – irreducible prolapse\n\nExternal hemorrhoids are usually asymptomatic unless thrombosis develops, which is frequently due to trauma and straining. They present as a painful blue lump at the anal verge.\nPatients older than 40 years or with atypical symptoms should undergo complete colonic investigation to exclude cancer. Inﬂammatory bowel disease is marked by bloody diarrhea\n\n\nTreatment\nMedical treatment aims to promote soft, formed, regular bowel movements: 1. with a high-ﬁber diet (20–30 g/day). bulking agents (psyllium husk: e.g., Metamucil™, 1 packet 1–3 times/day)\n\ngenerous water intake (six 8-ounce glasses of water/day).\nWarm sitz baths are helpful to relax the anal sphincter.",

The equation are as follows:\n\\[\n[H^+ = 24 x (PCO_2 / HCO_3)]\n\\] The dynamics of \\(PCO_2 / HCO_3\\) identifies the primary acid base disorders and the secondary responses. If the primary changes if the \\(PCO_2\\) then the disturbance if called respiratory acidosis or alkalosis, if the primary forces is the changes in \\(HCO_3\\) then it is metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. If there are primary forces, the the body will reacth with secondary responses to limit the changes in \\(H^+\\). This accomplished by changing the other component of \\(PCO_2 / HCO_3\\) ratio in the same direction. if the primary problem is an increase in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis), the secondary response will involve an increase in HCO3, and this will limit the change in [H+] produced by the increase in PaCO2. Secondary responses should not be called “compensatory responses” because they do not completely correct the change in [H+] produced by the primary acid-base disorder.(Marino 2014)\n\nMetabolic Acidosis\nThe secondary response to metabolic acidosis is an increase in minute ventilation (tidak volume and respiratory rate) thus resulting in decreased of \\(PCO_2\\). This response appears in 30 - 120 minutes, and can take 12 - 24 hours to complete. The magnitude of the response is defined by the equation:\n\\[\n\\Delta PaCO_2 = 1.2 \\times \\Delta HCO_3\n\\] Using the normal PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, a normal HCO3 of 24 mEq/L \\[\nExpected \\ PaCO_2 = 40 - [1.2 times (24 - currect \\  HCO_3)]\n\\] For a metabolic acidosis with a plasma HCO3 of 14 mEq/L, the ΔHCO3 is 24 – 14 = 10 mEq/L, the ΔPaCO2 is 1.2 × 10 = 12 mm Hg, and the expected PaCO2 is 40 – 12 = 28 mm Hg. If the PaCO2 is &gt; 28 mm Hg, there is a secondary respiratory acidosis. If the PaCO2 is &lt; 28 mm Hg, there is a secondary respiratory alkalosis.\n\n\nMetabolic Alkalosis\nThe secondary response to metabolic alkalosis is a decrease in minute ventilation and a subsequent increase in PaCO2.\n\\[\n\\Delta PaCO_2 = 0.7 x \\Delta HCO_3\n\\] Using a normal PaCO2 of 40 mmHg and a normal HCO3 of 24 mEq/L, the above equation can be rewritten as follows:\n\\[\nExpected \\ PaCO_2 = 40 + [0.7 times (current \\ HCO_3 - 24)]\n\\] For a metabolic alkalosis with a plasma HCO3 of 40 mEq/L, the ΔHCO3 is 40 – 24 = 16 mEq/L, the ΔPaCO2 is 0.7 × 16 = 11 mm Hg, and the expected PaCO2 is 40 + 11 = 51 mm Hg.\n\n\nRespiratory Acidosis\n\n\nRespiratory Alkalosis\n\n\n\n\n25.2.2 Liver Function Test\n\nGeneral Liver Function\n\nExcretion Functions (Test bilirubin, urobilinogen)\nSynthetic Functions (Serum protein, albumin, globuilin, prothrombin,ammonia)\nGeneral Metabolic Functions\nStorage Site\nHematopoeisis\nCatabolism of Steoroid Hormones\nClearence of Exogenous Substances (Bromosulphthalein)\n\nliver has a large amount of anatomical and functional reserve and capacity for rapid regeneration, functional deficiency becomes apparent if there is an extensive liver damage. Test for hepatic Injury (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, 5’-nucleotidase)\nIndication of Liver Function Test:\n\nScreen for liver disease;\nIdentify the nature of liver disease (hepatocellular, cholestatic, or infiltrative);\nAssess severity and prognosis of liver disease; and\nFollow up the course of liver disease\n\nLimitation Liver Function Test:\n\nDo not necessarily assess liver function\nLack sensitivity (i.e. may be normal in some liver diseases like cirrhosis)\nLack specificity (i.e. may be abnormal in non-liver disorders e.g. serum albumin is low in nephrotic syndrome and in cirrhosis)\n\nNon hepatic Cause of Abnormal lver Function Test: Increased serum bilirubin: – Hemolysis – Ineffective erythropoiesis – Resorption of a large hematoma\nIncreased aminotransferases: – Muscle injury – Alcohol abuse – Myocardial infarction\nIncreased serum alkaline phosphatase: – Pregnancy – Bone disease\nLow serum albumin: – Poor nutritional status – Proteinuria – Malabsorption – Severe illness causing protein catabolism\n\nExcretion Function\n\nBilirubin metabolism\nBiliruin is mostly (85%) from breakdown of HB of Old red cells in reticuloendothelial cells, mainly in Spleen. Normal serum bilirubin is less than 1 mg/dl. Common method to measure bilirubin are Diazo methods, which measure total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin (thus named an direct bilirubin), while the unconjugated bilirubin were calculated from substraction of total bilirubin - conjugated bilirubin Other derived from premature destruction of red cell precusor in bone marrow. The Steps are following:\n\n\n\nNormal Bilirubin Metabolism\n\n\n\nHB, degraded within macropahes to form heme and globin. Globin consist of amino acids, which are recycled. While Heme (iron + protoporphyrin) release iron, which is stored as ferritin. The protoporphyrin then converted to biliverdin, then to bilirubin.(Kawthalkar 2018)\nReleased bilirubin into the circulation and bind albumin, this called unconjugated bilirubin. It is insoluble to water, but lipid soluble.\nBillirubin-albumin complex reaches the liver whee it is taken up by the hepatocytes. Albumin released back to the circulation.\nBilirubin then conjugated with glucoronic acid to form bilirubin monoglucoronid and diglucoronid (conjugated bilirubin). This Process is mediated by the ezyme glucoronyl transferase. Conjugated bilirubin is more soluble in water.\nConjugated bilirubin is secreted from the hepatocytes into biliary canaliculi, from where it passes into the bile duct and gallbladder along with bile.\nWhen bilirubin reaches the large instensites, it is converted to urobilinogen by the baterial enzyme.\nMost urobilinogen is excreted in feses as urobilin, thus coloring the feses yellow. A part of urobilinogen is absorbed into the circlation from where it reaches the liver, taken up and reexcreted into the bile. Small amaount of urobilinogen in cleared in urine.\n\nJaundice or icterus referes to yellow discoloration of skin, screa and mucous membranes due to increased level of serum bilirubin. Jaundice will clinicaly evident when serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.0 mg/dL.\n\nAccording to type of dominant bilirubin:\n\nA. Predominant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia\nIf &gt; 85% of total is unconjugated bilirubin or indirect bilirubin. The cause are hemolysis, ineffective eryhtropoeisus, resorption large hematome, gilbert syndrome.\nB. Predominant conjugated hyperbilirubinemia\nIf &gt; 50% of total is conjugated or direct bilirubin. Cause are hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholestasis, drugs (anabolic steroid, oral contraceptives), toxin, dubin johnson syndrome, rotor syndrome\nC. Mixed (Conjugated and Unconjugated)\nif conjugated bilirubin is 20-50% of total, it may results from viral or alcoholic hepatisis.\n\nAccording to site of disease\n\n\n\n\nSites of Cholestasis\n\n\nA. Prehepatic There is excessive formation of bilirubin exceeding the capacity of the liver to conjugate it for excretion. The dominant bilirubin is unconjugated. Bilirubin is absent in urine, since of is water insoluble. Urobilinogen is increased in urine and feses. Jaudice is usually mild (total bilirubin usually &lt; 5.0 mg/dl, conjugated is &lt; 15% of total). The cuase is usually hematological problem.\nB. Hepatic\nBoth Unconjugated and Conjuated are increased. mainly increased unconjunjugated 1. defective uptake 2. defective conjugation 3. physiologic jaundice (newborn)\nmainly Conjugated ilirubin 1. Hepatocellular disease: Liver enzume increase. Biliruibin is around 4.0 s.d 8.0 mg/dl. Conjugated bilirubin is 20-50% of total bilirubin. In hepatocellular injury, both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubins are increased. Unconjugated bilirubin is increased due to reduced ability of liver cells to conjugate bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is raised from cholestasis due to hepatocyte swelling.\n\nIntrahepatic Cholestasis: In intrahepatic cholestasis, there may be (1) impairment of secretion of bilirubin from hepatocytes into the biliary canaliculi; (2) obstruction of bile flow in canaliculi by swollen hepatocytes;or (3) damage to intrahepatic canaliculi.\n\nDrugs commonly associated with cholestatic injury are oral contraceptives, anabolic steroids, oral anti-diabetics, phenothiazines, and erythromycin.\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis, there is autoimmune destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged, females and is characterized by chronic eleva- tion of alkaline phosphatase and positive anti-mitochondrial antibody in serum.\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disorder occurring in young to middle-aged men in whom there is inflammation and destruction of both intrahepatic and extra-hepatic bile ducts. Associated inflammatory bowel disease is often present. Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated and many patients have circulating perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.\nC. Post Hepatic\nObstruction of extrahepatic biliary tract prevents flow of bile into the duodenum. This causes “regurgitation” of conjugated bilirubin into the circulation. (Biliary canaliculi distend and rupture due to backpressure of bile and conjugated bilirubin escapes into the sinusoids). Conjugated bilirubin is usually &gt;50% of total in posthepatic jaundice. Urinary and fecal urobilinogen are decreased, faeces are clay-colored, and bilirubin (being conjugated and water-soluble) appears in urine. Cause of Posthepatic Jaundice:\n\nCarcinoma of head of pancreas\nCarcinoma of ampulla of Vater\nSecondaries in porta hepatis\nGallstones in or stricture of common bile duct\n\n\n\n\nThree types of Jaundice Differential Diagnosis\n\n\n\n\nClinial Algorithm of Jaundice\nNormal serum bilirubin is less than 1 mg/dl. conjugated bilirubin is 10% or less, while unconjugated bilirubin is 90% or more. This is because conjugated bilirubin is rapidly secreted into the bile after its formation and removed through the gut. Conjugated bilirubin is composed of blirubin glucuronide, bilirubin diglucuronide, and delta (δ) bilirubin. Delta bilirubin represents bilirubin covalently bound to albumin in circulation. Normally, δ bilirubin is absent or present in very small amount. In cholestasis, proportion of δ-bilirubin increases. Owing to its longer half-life, it is cleared slowly from circulation. Conjugated bilirubin is weakly bound to albumin, is water-soluble, and can be excreted in urine. Unconjugated bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin and is water-insoluble.\n\n\n\nJaundice Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic Function\nMarkers of hepatic synthetic function are serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). Hypoalbuminemia and a prolonged PT indicate a severe functional impairment of liver.\n\nProtein Synthetic\nLiver is the sole organ to synthesisze plasma protein, except gamma globulin which synthesized by Plasma Cell. Normal total serum protein in adults is about 5.5 - 8.0 gm / dl, albumin 3.5 - 5.0 which comprise the 60% of serum protein.\nTest for protein in liver disease incldue total serum protein, serum albumin, calculation of albumin/globulin rtio (normal &gt; 1.5) and serum electrophoresis.the common laboratory method to measure total protein is biuret and refractometer method.\nTotal serum protein level is affected by both and gamma globulins. In cirrhosis, decrease in albumin level is often compensated by increase in the level of gamma globulins; therefore, estimation of total serum proteins is of limited value in cirrhosis. Estimation of serum albumin and serum protein electrophoresis are more helpful.\nAlbumin is synthesized exclusively in liver and constitutes about 60% of total proteins in serum; therefore its estimation is an important investigation in liver disease. Half-life of albumin is about 20 days and therefore fall in its level in response to decreased synthesis is not immediately apparent. Therefore, in acute liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis), there is little change in albumin level. Serum albumin level is low in chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) and correlates with synthetic capacity of hepatocytes; therefore, it is helpful in following progression of cirrhosis. Also, fall in serum albumin level correlates with severity of ascites. In cirrhosis and in chronic active hepatitis, serum gamma globulins are increased due to inflammation. Low albumin and raised gamma globulins in serum cause reversal of albumin/globulin ratio. Serum albumin is estimated by bromocresol green method\nCauses of decreased serum albumin: • Decreased intake: malnutrition. • Decreased absorption: malabsorption syndromes. • Decreased synthesis: liver disease, chronic infections. • Increased catabolism: thyrotoxicosis, fever, malignancy, infections. • Increased loss: nephrotic syndrome, severe burns, protein-losing enteropathies, ascites • Increased blood volume: pregnancy, congestive cardiac failure.\nSerum Protein Elektrophoresis: 1. In cirrhosis, albumin may be reduced and there may be polyclonal increase of IgG and IgA, with β-γ bridging. (IgA migrates between β and γ regions which obscures the demarcation between β and γ peaks). 2. In primary biliary cirrhosis, there is polyclonal increase of IgM. 3. In α1-antitrypsin deficiency (associated with cirrhosis) α1- globulin band is reduced. 4. In chronic active hepatitis, IgG is elevated.\n\n\n\nSerum Protein Electrophoresis patterns and densitometer scans in Normal, Cirhosis and Alpha 1 antitripsin deficienct individuals\n\n\n\n\nProthorombin Time (PT)\nMost of the coagulation protein are synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K is required for the synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X by the hepatocytes, thus it is called vitamin K dependent factors. Synthesis of the factors is deficient in hepatocellular disease. In Addition, in obstructive jaundice, vitamin K (a fat soluble vitamin) cannot be absorbed due to the absence of bile in the intentine.\nPT measures three out of four vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, and X) and is prolonged in hepatocellular disease and in obstructive jaundice. Intramuscular injection of vitamin K corrects prolonged PT in obstructive jaundice but not in hepatocellular jaundice. To distinguish between a prolonged PT due to hepato- cellular disease from that due to cholestasis with fat malabsorption, PT is repeated after administration of vitamin K. Reduction of prolonged PT occurs in cholestatic liver disease, but not in hepatocellular disease. In acute fulminant liver failure, marked prolongation of PT is an unfavourable prognostic sign.\n\n\nBlood Ammonia\nBlood ammonia is mainly derived from GI tract. In the gut, bacterial enzyme act on nitrogen-containing foods to produce ammonia, which is carried to the liver via portal vein. In the liver, ammonia is converted to non -toxic urea in urea cycle.\nIncreased blood ammonia seen in: - Fulminant hepatic failure - cirrhosis - Reye’s Syndrome - “Shunting” of portal blood to systemic circulation - Gastrointestinal hemmorhage (there is increased of production of ammonia from blood proteins by bacterial enzymes). In hepatic disease, gastrointestinal hemmorhage is associated with increased risk of hepatic encepalopathy. - Inherited deficiensys of ure cycle enzymes.\nIf the ammonia is inreased, it might helful indicates a hepatic encepalopathy.\n\n\n\nTest Hepatocellular Injury\nSerum enzyme changes in liver disease result from hepatocyte damage and do not indicate hepatic functional capacity.\n\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase or AST (formerly called serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase or SGOT)\nSerum alanine aminotransferase or ALT (formerly called serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or SGPT)\nSerum alkaline phosphatase or ALP\nγ-Glutamyl transferase or GGT (also called as - γ-glutamyl transpeptidase)\n5’-nucleotidase (5’-NT)\n\n\nSerum Aminotransferase (Transaminitis)\nBoth AST and ALT are sensitive marker of hepatocellular injury. ALT is cytosolic enzyme, AST is cytosolic and mitochondria. Normally, aminotransferases are present in serum at a low level. When necrosis or death of cells containing these enzymes occurs, aminotransferases are released into the blood and their concentration in blood increases. This level correlates with extent of tissue damage.\n“Most marked elevations of ALT and AST (&gt;15 times normal) are seen in acute viral hepatitis, toxin-induced hepatocellular damage (e.g. carbon tetrachloride), and centrilobular necrosis due to ischemia (congestive cardiac failure).”\nModerate elevation (5-15X normal) occurs due to chronic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, acute biliary tract obstruction, and drug induced hepatitis. Mild elevation (1-3 x normal) seen in cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatosis and cholestasis.\nNormal ratio AST/ALT is 0.7 to 1.4. Increased ratio (&gt;2.0) is highly suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis, while ratio &lt;1.0 is seen in acute viral hepatitis. ALT and AST are elevated in acute viral hepatitis even before the appearance of jaundice. Persistence of elevated ALT and AST beyond 6 months in a case of hepatitis indicates development of chronic hepatitis. Measurement of ALP is helpful in differentiation of hepatocellular jaundice from cholestatic jaundice.\n\n\nSerum Alkaline Phospatase (ALP)\nAlkaline phosphatase is distributed widely in various tissues like liver, bones, intestine, kidney, and placenta. In the liver, ALP, GGT, and 5’-NT are located normally on canalicular surface of hepatocytes. In cholestasis, accumulated bile acids dissolve canalicular side of hepatocyte membrane and enzymes are released in blood. Therefore, diseases that affect mainly hepatocyte secretion have elevated levels of ALP.\nALP is increased in most cases of cholestatic type of jaundice. While hepatocellular injury is characterized by marked elevation of ALT and AST, cholestasis is characterized by marked increase (more than 3 times normal) of ALP. Since there are many other sources of ALP apart from liver, simultaneous measurement of serum GGT and serum 5’-NT may be used to ascertain whether increase of ALP is of hepatic origin. Main cause of increased ALP due to hepatobiliary disease are: Bile duct obstruction, primary biliarry cirhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, infilstrative diseae of liver.\nDisease of bones also could cause increased ALP. ALP present within osteoblasts, thus ALP increase when there is an increase osteoblastic activity. Pregnancy also increase ALP due to increased secretion from plancenta.\n\n\nSerum Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)\nGGT presents in liver, pancreas, kidney, and prostate. The estimation of this enzyme is particularly useful in following: alcoholism (acute alcoholic hepatitis); Cholestasis (elevation of ALP and GGT significantly points toward liver disease); recovery from acute hepatitis (GGT is the last enzyme to return to normal, thus its normalization indicative favourable outcome)\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Liver Function Test\nLiver disease could broadly classified into two: hepatocellular and cholestasis.\n1. Typical LFT profile in hepatocellular disease\n• Marked elevation of AST and ALT (usually &gt;500 IU)\n• Mild increase of ALP (&lt;3 times normal)\n• Hyperbilirubinemia, if present, is of both conjugated and unconjugated type\n• Chronic hepatocellular injury, aminotransferases are moderately elevated, and serum albumin is reduced.\nIf the LFT showed a hepatocellular disease, then next investigation is to detect underlying cause:\n\nViral serology (viral hepatitis: IgM anti-hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis surface B antigen (HBsAg), antihepatitis C antibody),\nsearch for injurious drugs, toxins or alcohol,\nautoantibodies like antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (autoimmune hepatitis), and serum ceruloplasmin (Wilson disease).\n\n\n\n\nHistory of Jaundice of nonspecific acute illness in the setting of increased aminotransferase\n\n\nIf cause is not detected in the presence of persistent elevation of aminotransferases, liver biopsy is performed (that may reveal chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, Wilson disease, haemochromatosis, and infiltrative diseases)\n2. Typical LFT profile in cholestatic jaundice\n• Marked elevation of ALP (&gt;3 times normal)\n• Elevation of GGT and 5’-NT\n• Mild or no increase of ALT and AST (usually &lt;200 IU)\n• Elevation of conjugated bilirubin\n• The pattern of elevated ALP but normal serum bilirubin is seen in infiltrative diseases\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Raised ALP in the suspicion of cholestatic injury\n\n\nIn patients with cholestatic or infiltrative pattern of injury, imaging studies should be done for diagnosis of obstruction. If there is no evidence of obstruction, liver biopsy is usually done\nFinally, Severity of liver disease is assessed by serum bilirubin, serum albumin, and prothrombin time. Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification is commonly used to assess severity of cirrhosis and is based on both clinical and laboratory parameters\n\n\n\nChild-Turcotte-Pugh score to assese severity of cirhosis\n\n\n\nNormal Values\nSerum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT): 5-42 U/L\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT): 5-40 U/L\nSerum alkaline phosphatase (ALP):\n• Children: 25-350 U/L\n• Adult males: 25-120 U/L\n• Adult females: 25-90 U/L\nAST/ALT ratio: 0.7-1.4\nSerum bilirubin:\n• Total: 0.3-1.0 mg/dl\n• Direct (Conjugated): 0-0.2 mg/dl\nSerum proteins, total: 5.5-8.0 gm/dl\nSerum albumin: 3.5-5.0 gm/dl\nSerum globulins: 1.8-3.5 gm/dl\nAlbumin/Globulin (A/G) ratio: &gt;1.5\nProthrombin time: 11-15 seconds\nPlasma ammonia: 9-33 μmol/L\nSerum gammaglutamyl transferase:\n• Males: Up to 40 U/L\n• Females: Up to 25 U/L\nSerum protein electrophoresis:\nAlbumin 52-65%\nα1 globulin: 2.5-5%\nα2 globulin: 7-13%\nβ globulin: 8-14%\nγ globulin: 12-22%\n\n\n\n\n25.2.3 Disorder of Lipids\n\n\n25.2.4 Cardiac markers\n\n\n25.2.5 Coagulation Study\n\n\n25.2.6 Renal Function Test\nKidney performs following functions: 1. maintenance of extracellular fluid volume & composition 2. Excretion of metabolic waste 3. Regulation of blood pressure 4. synthesis of erytheropoeitin 5. Production of Vitamin D3\nKidney functions affected by:\n\nDiffuse renal disease\nPre-renal conditions\nPost-renal conditions\n\nClassification of renal Function Test\nA. Evaluation of Glomerular Function\nB Evaluation of Tubular Function\n\nA. Test to Evaluaste Glomerular Function\nThe best test to evaluate overall kidney functions is estimation of GFR. GFR varies with age, sex and BSA. Normal GFR in young adults is 120-130 ml/min per 1.73 m2 of body surface area. GFR declines progressively with age (due to arteriolosclerosis of glomeruli). After 40 years of age, there is a steady and progressive fall in the GFR at the rate of 1 ml/minute/year because of reduction in the number of glomeruli due to arteriolosclerosis.\nKdigo 2022 divide Chronic Kidney Disease into :\n\nStage 1; Kidney damage with Normal to increased GFR (GFR \\(\\geq\\) 90 ml / min / 1.73 m2)\nStage 2; Kidney damage with Mildly reduced GFR (GFR 60 - 89 ml / min / 1.73 m2)\nStage 3; Moderately reduced GFR (GFR 30 - 59 ml / min / 1.73 m2)\nStage 4; Severely reduced GFR (GFR 15 - 29 ml / min / 1.73 m2)\nStage 5; Kidney Failure (GFR \\(\\leq\\) 15 ml / min / 1.73 m2)\n\nKidney damage refers to presence of pathological abnormalities in blood or urine test or imaging studies. Symtoms usually present at GFR less than 60, which reflect loss of 50% Kidney Function.\nGFR, glomerular filtration rate referes to the rate in ML/min at which a substance is cleared from the circulation by the glomeruli. The ability of the glomeruli to filter a substance from the blood is assessed by clearance studies. If a substance is not bound to protein in plasma, is completely filtered by the glomeruli, and is neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the tubules, then its clearance rate is equal to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nClearance of a substance refers to the volume of plasma, which is completely cleared of that substance per minute; it is calculated from the following formula:\n\\[\nclearance = \\frac{UV}{P}\n\\]\nU: concentration of substance in urine (mg/dl)\nV: volume of urine excreted in ml/min\nP: concentration of substance in plasma (mg/dl)\nall clearance value are adjusted to standard body surface area: 1.73 m2.\nClearance tests are cumbersome to perform, expensive, and not readily available. One major problem with clearance studies is incomplete urine collection.\nThe Particular “substance” are molecules which having the following properties: 1. It should be physiologically inert and preferably endogenous,\n\nIt should be freely filtered by glomeruli and should be neither reabsorbed nor secreted by renal tubules,\n\n3 It should not bind to plasma proteins and should not be metabolized by kidneys\n4 It should be excreted only by the kidneys\nExample of substance used to measure GFR are:\n\nExogenous: Inulin, Radiolabelled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (51Cr- EDTA), 125I-iothalamate\nEndogenous: Creatinine, Urea, Cystatin C\n\n\nInulin Clearance\nInulin is inert polysacharide derived from the plant. It is called inert as it is freely filtered by the glomerulus, and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the tubules thus Inulin is an ideal agent for measuring GFR.\nProtocol: A bolus dose of inulin (25 ml of 10% solution IV) is administered followed by constant intravenous infusion (500 ml of 1.5% solution at the rate of 4 ml/min). Timed urine samples are collected and blood samples are obtained at the midpoint of timed urine collection. Average inulin clearance for males is 125 ml/min/1.73 m2 and for females is 110 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\nCystatin C Clearance\nThis is a cysteine protease inhibitor of MW 13,000, which is produced at a constant rate by all the nucleated cells. It is not bound to protein, is freely filtered by glomeruli and is not returned to circulation after filtration. It is a more sensitive and specific marker of impaired renal function than plasma creatinine. Its level is not affected by sex, diet, or muscle mass. It is thought that cystatin C is a superior marker for estimation of GFR than creatinine clearance.\n\n\nCreatinine Clearance\nCreatinine is being produced constantly from creatine in muscle. It is completely filtered by glomeruli and is not reabsorbed by tubules; however, a small amount is secreted by tubules.\nA 24-hour urine sample is preferred. After getting up in the morning, the first voided urine is discarded. Subsequently all the urine passed is collected in the container provided. After getting up in the next morning, the first voided urine is also collected and the container is sent to the laboratory.\nA blood sample for estimation of plasma creatinine is obtained at midpoint of urine collection.\nCreatinine clearance is calculated from:\n\nconcentration of creatinine in urine in mg/ml (U),\nvolume of urine excreted in ml/min (V) (this is calculated by the formula: volume of urine collected/collection time in minutes e.g. volume of urine collected in 24 hours ÷ 1440)\nconcentration of creatinine in plasma in mg/dl (P).\nCreatinine clearance in ml/min per 1.73 m2 is then derived from the formula UV/P.\n\nBecause of secretion of creatinine by renal tubules, the above formula overestimates GFR by about 10%. In advanced renal failure, secretion of creatinine by tubules is increased and thus overestimation of GFR is even more. Overestimation of GFR due to tubular secretion of creatinine is somewhat balanced by slight overestimation of serum creatinine by Jaffe’s reaction. To provide values closer to the actual GFR, cimetidine (which blocks secretion by renal tubules) can be administered before commencing urine collection\nCreatinine clearance has few weakness:\n\nTubular secretion of creatinin that icrease as the kidney disease advance\nCollection of urine often incomplete\nCreatinin level is affected by protein intake and muscle mass\nCreatinine level also affected by drugs, ie Cimetidine, Trimetophrim (which block tubular secretion of creatinine)\n\nTips: BUN and serum creatinine, by themselves, are not sensitive indicators of early renal impairment since values may be normal e.g. if baseline values of serum creatinine is 0.5 mg/dl, then 50% reduction in kidney function would increase it to 1.0 mg/dl. Thus clearance tests are more helpful in early cases. If biochemical tests are normal and renal function impairment is suspected, then creatinine clearance test should be carried out. If biochemical tests are abnormal, then clearance tests need not be done.\n\n\nUrea Clearance\nUrea is filtered by the glomeruli, but about 40% of the filtered amount is reabsorbed by the tubules. The reabsorption depends on the rate of urine flow. Thus it underestimates GFR, depends on the urine flow rate, and is not a sensitive indicator of GFR.\n\n\nEstimation of Creatinine Clearance from serum creatinin by equation\nEstimation of GFR from Serum creatinin depend on age, sex, body weight and serum creatinine value (and in some formula includes ethnicity). This is called as estimated GFR (eGFR).\n\nModified Cockroft Gauld Equation (if SC Mg/Dl) \\[\nCreatine Clearance (ml/min) = \\frac{(140 - age) \\times (Weight) }{72 \\times SC}\n\\]\n\nIn females, the value obtained from above equation is multiplied by 0.85 to get the result.\n\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation for estimated eGFR: \\[\neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (s. creatinine in mg/dL) – 1.154 × (Age in year)–0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.210 if African – American)\n\\] This is applicable for adults between 18 and 70 years of age. It is more accurate than measured creatinine clearance from 24-hour urine collection and Cockroft-Gault equation. This is the most commonly used equation.\nCKD-EPI (chronic kidney disease-epidemiology) equation: This is a recently introduced more accurate equation.\n\n\\[\neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 141 × min (Scr/k,1)a × max (Scr/k, 1)–1.209 × (0.993)Age ×\n1.018 (if female) × 1.159 (if black)\n\\] where, Scr = Standardized serum creatinine (mg/dL) K = 0.7 (female) or 0.9 (male) a = –0.329 (female) or –0.411 (male), min = minimum of Scr/k or 1, max = maximum of Scr/k or 1, Age = years\n\nIn Children, Schwartz formula is used for estimation of GFR:\n\n\\[\nEstimated GFR = \\frac{K \\times Height (cm)}{Sc}\n\\] k = 0.33 in preterm babies for the first year of life; k=0.45 for full term infants; for infants and children up to 12 years of age k is 0.55.\nDisadvantages of estimated GFR: 1. GFR estimated by Ckockcroft-Gault and MDRD formulas tends to underestimate renal function at high levels of GFR (&gt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m2);\n\nValues may be misleading in acute kidney injury, pregnancy, decreased muscle mass (e.g. paraplegia, muscle wasting disorders, critically ill, patients with cancer), increased muscle mass in athletes and body builders, unusual diets, and extremes of age or weight.\n\n\nBlood Urea Nitrogen\nUrea is produced in the liver from amino acids. Amino acids are utilized to produce energy, synthesize proteins, and are catabolized to ammonia. Urea is produced in the liver from ammonia in the Krebs urea cycle. Ammonia is toxic, and hence, is converted to urea, which is then excreted in urine.\nThe concentration of blood urea is usually expressed as blood urea nitrogen. This is because older methods estimated only the nitrogen in urea. Molecular weight of urea is 60, and 28 g of nitrogen are present in a gram mole of urea. As the relationship between urea and BUN is 60/28, BUN can be converted to urea by multiplying BUN by 2.14, i.e. the real concentration of urea is BUN × (60/28). Urea is completely filtered by the glomeruli, and about 30–40% of the filtered amount is passively reabsorbed in the renal tubules depending on the person’s state of hydration.\nlood level of urea is affected by a number of nonrenal factors (e.g. dehydration, hypoperfusion of kidneys, high protein diet, protein catabolism, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, liver function, steroid administration, etc.), and therefore, utility of BUN as an indicator of renal function is limited. Also considerable destruction of renal parenchyma is required before elevation of blood urea can occur.\nThe term azotemia refers to the increase in the blood level of urea; uremia is the clinical syndrome resulting from this increase. Reference range for BUN in adults is 7–18 mg/dL. In adults &gt;60 years, level is 8–21 mg/dL. laboratory method to analyze BUN are Diacetyl monoxime urea and urease-Brthol reaction.\n\n\nSerum Creatinin\nCreatinine is a nitrogenous waste product formed in muscle from creatine phosphate. Endogenous production of creatinine is proportional to muscle mass and body weight. Exogenous creatinine (from ingestion of meat) has little effect on daily creatinine excretion.\nSerum creatinine is a more specific and more sensitive indicator of renal function as compared to BUN because: - It is produced from muscles at a constant rate and its level in blood is not affected by diet, protein catabolism, or other exogenous factors - It is not reabsorbed, and very little is secreted by tubules.\nSignificant kidney reserve, increase of serum creatinine level (from 1.0 mg/dl to 2.0 mg/dl) in blood does not occur until about 50% of kidney function is lost. Therefore, serum creatinine is not a sensitive indicator of early renal impairment (SC_gfr?). Laboratory report showing serum creatinine “within normal range” does not necessarily mean that the level is normal; the level should be correlated with body weight, age and sex of the individual. If renal function is absent, serum creatinine rises by 1.0 to 1.5 mg/dL/day.\n\n\n\nRelationship between glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine. Significant increase of serum creatinine does not occur till a considerable fall in GFR\n\n\nCauses of decreased serum creatinine level:\n\nFemale sex.\nVegetarian diet.\nMalnutrition, muscle wasting.\nIncreasing age (reduction in muscle mass)\n\nMethods to estimate serum creatinin is Jaffe reaction and Enzymatic Methods. Reference range Adult males: 0.7–1.3 mg/dL. Adult females: 0.6–1.1 mg/dL.\n\n\nBUN/Serum Creatinin Ratio\nBUN/creatinine ratio to discriminate prerenal and postrenal azotemia from renal azotemia. Normal ratio is 12:1 to 20:1.\nCauses of increased BUN/creatinine ratio (&gt;20:1): 1. Increased BUN with normal serum creatinine:\n\nPre-renal azotemia (reduced renal perfusion)\n\n– High protein diet\n– Increased protein catabolism\n– Gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\n\nIncrease of both BUN and serum creatinine with disproportionately greater increase of BUN:\n\nPostrenal azotemia (Obstruction to the outflow of urine) Obstruction to the urine outflow causes diffusion of urinary urea back into the blood from tubules because of backpressure.\n\nCauses of decreased BUN/creatinine ratio (&lt;10:1):\n\n\nAcute tubular necrosis\nLow protein diet, starvation\nSevere liver disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Test To Evaluaste Tubular Functions\nRenal tubules efficiently reabsorb 99% of the glomerular filtrate to conserve the essential substances. Abnormality tubular function includes:\n\nGLycosuria\nGeneralized Aminoaciduria\nTUbular Proteinuria\nUrinary concentration of sodium\nFractional excretion of sodum.\n\n\n\n\n25.2.7 Urine Analysis\n\nMacroscopy\n\n\nMicroscopy\n\n\nChemical\n\nAlbuminuria\nNormally, a very small amount of albumin is excreted in urine. The earliest evidence of glomerular damage in diabetes mellitus is occurrence of microalbuminuria (albuminuria in the range of 30 to 300 mg/24 hours). An albuminuria &gt;300 mg/24 hour is termed clinical or overt and indicates significant glomerular damage. Urine protein to creatinine ratio on a randome urine sample has been shown to correlate well with estimation of 24-hour urine protein.\n\n\n\n\nKawthalkar, Shirish M. 2018.

Banyak peneliti menghindari dgmatic statement: “cause” or “produces”\nCausation: occurs when a change in one variable produces a change in another variable\n\nContributory Cause, no single specific cause of a disease. Most of disease cause by multifactorial etiologies. A risk factor may a contributory cause.\n\nThree criteria: 1. Association may be reflected by effect size 2. Prior Association, does the cause (independent var) precede the effects (dependent var) (case control or cohort), 3. Altering the cause alters the effects\nSome other features of contributory causation:\n\nConsistency: the results of study (effect size) should be consistent regardless the design, the population used.\nDose response relathionsip\nBiologic Plausibility: should make biologic sense.\nExperimental confirmation: phenomenon found in lcinical studies have to be consistent with studies in animal models.\n\n\nNecessary cause, dibuktikan sebagai satu satunya penyebab. Sebagai contoh: fullfiled by Koch’s Postulates: the organism is always found with the disease.\n\nAssociation: can be observed between many variable, but causaton only be determined from data collected from a controlled experiment.\n\nSpurious association, association no actually present in population 3 mekanisme spurious causation\n\nChance, due to random error and sampling variation (Individual chance to be a sample not equal), karakteristik sampel terlalu heterogen. Minimize random error: adequate sample size and low type 1 and type 2 error.

Sample size harus sesuai untuk memenuhi statistical significance dan clinically important, tanpa membuang sumber daya terlalu banyak.\nSampel size berhubungan power. Power = makin kuat penelitian mampu mendeteksi sebuah efek di populasi, maka semakin banyak sample size dibutuhkan.\nDefinition of Power: the probability of concluding the new treatment is effective if it truly is effective. Biasanya 80% type I error = the probability of concluding that the new treatment is effective if it truly is not effective. (positive palsu, alpha) type II error = the probability of concluding the new treatment not effective if it is truly effective (negative palsu, 1 - power atau beta)\nElemen menentukan sample size: \\(\\Delta\\) = effect size or difference under null hypotesis (perbedaan klinis yang dianggap penting) diambil dari studi sebelumnya dan tinjauan pustaka. Jika effect size besar, maka sampel di butuhkan lebih kecil, begitu kebalikannya \\(\\alpha\\) = type I error, 0,05 \\(\\beta\\) = type 2 error, 0,2 \\(\\sigma\\) = standard deviation, makin heterogen populasi maka sample size makin besar. r = ratio of number of patients in the two groups, usually r = 1\nHubungan sampel size dengan hasil presisi, dimana hasil confidence interval akan lebih sempit (lebih presisi) jika sample size besar. Jika hipotesis 2 arah, sample lebih besar, biasanya lebih disarankan hipotesis 2 arah. Pertimbangan tambahan sampel jika kemungkinan loss to follow up terutama pada kohort prospektif dan clinical trial. Jika cross sectional, tidak perlu. Jika tidak ada studi sebelumnya sebagai patokan sampel, maka tetap harus memperhitungkan sampel dengan cara pilot study.\nJika tidak bisa memenuhi jumlah sampel sesuai perhitungan sebelum penelitian (apriori), kita bisa mennetukan apakah hasil studi kita underpower dengan memperhitungkan hasil tes post-hoc.\nStategi meminimalkan sample size - pakai varibael kontinyu - paired measurement.\nrule of thumb: 10 - 50 per variabel, atau 30 sampel.

Pertanyaan penelitian ini adalah apakah kongesti vena (diukur dengan kateter arteri pulmoner) merupakan faktor yang berasosiasi dengan perburukan fungsi ginjal pada pasien ADHF. Tujuan lainnya adalah menjawab apakah asosiasi tersebut lebih bermakna dibandingkan asosiasi penurunan cardiac output (diukur dengan cardiac index) terhadap penurunan fungsi ginjal, dimana secara umum teori yang diterima adalah faktor utama perburukan fungsi ginjal pada ADHF adalah penurunan cardiac output.\nPenelitian ini cenderung mendukung Causation antara kongesti vena dengan penurunan fungsi ginjal. Hal ini karena variabel independen berkontribusi terhadap penurunan fungsi ginjal (ditemukan asosiasi melalui perhitungan statistik). CVP ditemukan lebih tinggi baik saat admisi dan setelah mendapatkan terapi ADHF secara intensif pada pasien yang mengalami perburukan fungsi ginjal. Secara prospektif, ketika pasien mendapatkan terapi ADHF dan CVP berhasil diturunkan &lt;8 mmHg, pasien yang kemudian mengalami perburukan fungsi ginjal lebih jarang ditemukan (mendukung prior association). Causation yang ditemukan merupakan contributory cause. Terdapat beberapa variabel yang bisa menjadi confounding karena tidak dilakukan pemeriksaan diantaranya regional renal perfusion, kelainan struktural ginjal, serta analisis data secara multivariabel tidak dilakukan\n\n\nIde Penelitian Selanjutnya:\nHubungan diameter dan collapsibility index inferior vena cava terhadap perburukan fungsi ginjal pada pasien acute decompensated heart failure.",

    "text": "5.2 Joint Disease\n\n5.2.1 Crystal Deposition Disease\n\nGout and Hyperuricemia\nGout is a metabolic disorder resulting from the tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals in or around joints and/or the crystallization of uric acid in the renal collecting system. The metabolic derangement responsible for gout is the supersaturation of blood and body fluids with the urate ion to the point that crystal formation is possible. At physiologic pH and at normal body temperature, urate is considered to be supersaturated at concentrations of 6.8 mg/dL or greater. Therefore, from a biologic perspective, hyperuricemia is any serum urate level greater than 6.8 mg/dL in both men and women. Although hyperuricemia is a necessary prerequisite for developing gout, only 20% of all hyperuricemic subjects will ultimately develop gout.\n\nEpidemiologi\nA number of factors have been proposed to explain this dramatic rise. These include the overall increase in longevity; the increased prevalence of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and obesity; the ubiquitous use of thiazide diuretics and low-dose aspirin; changes in dietary trends, including the greater use of high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener; and finally, the increase in survival of patients with end-stage renal disease and organ transplantation. There is a direct correlation between the degree of serum urate elevation and the likelihood of developing gout. The reported annual incidence of gout in subjects with baseline serum urate levels greater than or equal to 9 mg/dL is 4.9%, compared with only 0.5% in people with serum urate levels of 7.0 to 8.9 mg/dL.\n\n\npathobiology\nUric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans. In most mammals, purine catabolism is taken one step further through the enzyme uric acid oxidase or uricase, with the purine end product in these species being the very soluble allantoin. Humans and most other hominoids lost the ability to produce the enzyme uricase nearly 18 million years ago. As a result, uric acid accumulation is possible. Whether caused by overproduction of uric acid or its underexcretion by the kidneys, this accumulation leads to supersaturation of urate ion in blood and the precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid, soft tissues, and organs.\nUrate is produced by the conversion of a very soluble molecule, hypoxanthine, to the less soluble xanthine, which, in turn, is converted to the very insoluble uric acid by progressive purine ring oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is present in several organs, but most activity in the body is found in the liver and intestines. Because of its potential for causing disease, urate elimination is very important. The total daily accumulation of uric acid from de novo synthesis, nucleotide degradation, and dietary consumption is normally balanced by renal excretion of approximately two thirds of the total urate turnover and intestinal elimination by the remaining one third.\nSimply put, hyperuricemia occurs when urate production is not balanced by renal excretion. In 90% of all gout patients, the cause of this imbalance is renal underexcretion. The remaining 10% of gout cases are caused by purine overproduction or a combination of overproduction and underexcretion.\nuric acid is small and not protein bound, it is completely filtered by the glomerulus. In normal persons, approximately 8 to 10% of the filtered load is ultimately cleared in the urine. Both reabsorption and secretion occur in this segment through the actions of several organic acid transporters, with the net effect being the reabsorption of nearly 90% of the uric acid filtered at the glomerulus. These organic acid transporters are also responsible for eliminating organic acids other than uric acid as well as many commonly used medications. The gouty subjects excrete only 70% as much uric acid as normal individuals at any given serum urate concentration.\n10% of gouty subjects, hyperuricemia is caused by uric acid overproduction rather than reduced renal excretion. In most of these people, the hyperuricemia reflects accelerated cell turnover (e.g., lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases, psoriasis, chronic hemolytic states, polycythemia vera, and certain muscle glycogenoses) or by enhanced purine nucleotide breakdown (e.g., alcohol abuse or fructose ingestion). Regardless of the cause, urate overproduction is documented by a 24-hour urine collection showing greater than 1000 mg of uric acid while eating a standard Western diet.\nMonosodium urate crystals in joints, soft tissues, and organs are the cause of pain and destruction in gout. Urate crystals will form only when physiologic conditions permit. A reduction in pH or temperature will lower the solubility threshold even further. Not all people who are hyperuricemic will form crystals, however. There appears to be an additional requirement of a “nucleation factor” that is still poorly defined. Monosodium urate crystals form in joints and soft tissues of individuals long before they cause any symptoms of gout. They deposit in small lattice structures called microtophi on the surface of cartilage and synovial lining. These microtophi slowly grow but are generally stable as long as the environment surrounding them does not change drastically with regard to pH, urate concentration, or temperature. At the time of the first and subsequent flares, something does change in the joint environment to cause these crystal lattice structures to break apart and shed a massive number of crystals into the joint space. These newly released and nonopsonized crystals activate receptors on synovial macrophages and are then phagocytized by monocytes and macrophages, leading to interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome. This results in the rapid production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is responsible for all the cardinal features of the severe inflammation associated with acute gout.\nAlthough monocytes and macrophages are the major cellular sources of IL-1β, neutrophils predominate at the site of inflammation (e.g., joint), where monosodium urate crystals become extremely pro-inflammatory by activating neutrophils that then generate reactive oxygen species. However, neutrophils also have a major role in the resolution of acute gout through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophil proteases are released into the NETs and cause the formation of cell aggregates that contain cellular debris and DNA. These cellular aggregates within NETs can rapidly degrade pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby allowing for the spontaneous resolution of joint inflammation after 3 days (even in the absence of treatment). Therefore, neutrophils play a dual role in gouty inflammation, amplifying it initially but then mediating its resolution.\n\n\nClinical Manifestation\nClassic gout passes through three stages: asymptomatic hyperuricemia, acute intermittent gout symptoms, and chronic persistent gout symptoms. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia refers to a state in which serum urate exceeds the level of solubility (6.8 mg/dL) but symptoms of crystalline deposition have not yet occurred. Only 15 to 20% of all hyperuricemic people are prone to develop monosodium urate crystals, and for this group, the period of asymptomatic hyperuricemia begins a stage of subclinical structural changes. In men, asymptomatic hyperuricemia frequently begins at puberty, whereas in women, it is usually delayed until menopause.\nthe first flare usually occurs between the fourth and sixth decades of life. In women, the age of onset is older and varies with several factors, most importantly the age of menopause. The classic gout flare is hallmarked by the rapid development of warmth, swelling, erythema, and exquisite pain in one or occasionally two joints. The characteristically severe pain evolves from its faintest twinge to its most intense level over an 8- to 12-hour period. Initial episodes are usually monoarticular and involve lower extremity joints. The most common joint involved is the first metatarsal phalangeal joint (termed podagra), followed by the ankle, midfoot, and knee. After years of recurrent gouty flares, upper extremity joints, including the wrists, elbows, and small joints of the hands, can also become involved. Systemic symptoms of fever, chills, and malaise may accompany gouty flares, along with an intense erythema extending beyond the area of the involved joint. This may lead to confusion with an infectious process. Factors capable of provoking episodes of flare are those that cause fluctuations in serum urate levels, including trauma, surgery, starvation, overindulgence in certain high-purine foods, and the ingestion of any medication that raises or lowers serum urate.\nAnother characteristic of classic gout flares is their self-remitting nature for reasons discussed previously. For the first several acute flares, the duration of the attack is 5 to 8 days. The resolution of symptoms is gradual but complete, even if no anti-inflammatory therapy is administered. The periods between the flares are devoid of articular pain, although synovial fluid aspirates during this stage continue to show low-grade inflammation and the presence of monosodium urate crystals.\nthe untreated patient will progress to persistent gouty arthritis, also referred to as advanced gout. This stage usually develops after 10 or more years of acute intermittent gout and is evident when the pain-free intercritical periods have disappeared. The subcutaneous tophus is the most characteristic lesion of advanced gout. The development of tophaceous deposits of monosodium urate is a function of the duration and severity of hyperuricemia as well as the presence of proteinuria. Subcutaneous tophi may occur anywhere over the body but most commonly in the fingers, wrists, ears, knees, and olecranon bursa and at pressure points under the ulnar aspect of the forearm and Achilles tendon.\nApproximately 5% of patients with gout exhibit the onset of symptoms before age 25 years. Early-onset gout represents a special subset of patients who generally have a genetic component (see Table 257-2), with a more accelerated clinical course requiring more aggressive antihyperuricemic therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: A, The marked swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra) is demonstrated. A dusky blue hue over an intense erythema is characteristic. B, Ankle swelling is shown with erythema extending beyond the area of the tibiotalar joint.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnosis\nHyperuricemia is an essential risk factor for developing gout, but it is not a reliable diagnostic test because many people with elevated serum urate levels will never develop gout. Serum urate levels during an acute flare of gout are also unreliable because they may be suppressed by as much as 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL from baseline values. The definitive diagnosis of gout is made by polarized compensated microscopy of a synovial fluid aspirate from the affected joint. The presence of intracellular needle-shaped crystals with strong negative birefringence is the diagnostic “gold standard.” Similar microscopic results from a tophus aspirate or spontaneously draining fluid would also confirm the diagnosis of gout.\nThe presumptive diagnosis of gout is based on a pattern of acutejoint symptoms coupled with the patient’s own medical history or a family history. Key features include joint erythema, difficulty walking, time to maximal pain less than 24 hours, resolution by 2 weeks, presence of a tophus, and history of involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.7 The patient’s medical history may reveal comorbidities frequently associated with gout or the use of medications associated with urate retention. The characteristic clinical presentation is the rapid onset (over 8 to 12 hours) of severe pain in one or several lower extremity joints (especially the great toe, midfoot, and ankle).\nRadiographic evaluation is not helpful in the early phase of gout except to rule out fracture. In advanced gout, affected joints may show punched-out periarticular erosions with classic overhanging edges. Ultrasonography can detect monosodium urate crystals layered over articular cartilage in early disease and may be diagnostic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Comparison of ultrasonographic appearance of normal (left) and gouty (right) knee with the probe in the suprapatellar, transverse orientation and the knee in flexion. The normal knee shows soft tissues overlying an anechoic (black) layer that represents hyaline cartilage. The single bright stripe represents the bony cortex of the anterior distal femur. The gouty knee demonstrated the “double-contour” sign composed of a layer crystals covering the hyaline cartilage and the lower bright contour being the femoral cortex.\n\n\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute gout includes bacterial infection, trauma, sarcoidosis, and calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy (pseudogout). Diseases occasionally confused with advanced gout include rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, and calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy.\n\n\nTreatment\n\nEducation\nPatients be informed about dietary and other lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, that will lower their serum uric acid and lessen flares. Diet education inclde Avoid Organ meats High fructose corn syrup−sweetened drinks, and Alcohol overuse. Limit Beef, pork, lamb, shellfish, Beer. Encourage Low-fat dairy, smoking cessation and well hydrated.\n\n\nGout Flare\nThe treatment goal for gouty flare is to relieve pain and terminate the flare as quickly as possible. The therapeutic options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine, and corticosteroids. Ensuring adequate dosing of anti-inflammatory therapy, and continuing the treatment until the flare has completely resolved (usually 6 to 10 days). During the acute flare, subjects already taking urate lowering therapy should continue the drug, whereas those not receiving this therapy should not be started.\n\nNSAID: may be inappropriate for patients with renal insufficiency or peptic ulcer disease\nOral colchicine administered as 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the time of flare onset followed in 1 hour by a third 0.6-mg tablet is the recommended dosing for the first 24 hours. This is followed by 7 to 10 days of once-daily or twice-daily colchicine depending on renal function.\nCorticosteroid administered if poor renal function or intolerance to colcisine, Safer and similar efficacy than NSAIDS.\n\n\n\nMaintenance of Urate Lowering Therapy\nThe principal goal of treating gout is to lower the serum uric acid below its saturation point so that the process of crystallization will cease and the accumulated urate burden will be gradually diminished. Urate-lowering therapy is recommended for all patients with two or more gouty flares per year, patients with advanced disease, and those with kidney stones.\nBoth allopurinol and febuxostat are xanthine oxidase inhibitors that are considered first-line urate-lowering therapy.\n\n\nTreat to Target Approach\nThe American College of Rheumatology recommends a “treat-to-target” approach, using urate-lowering medications to lower serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL in patients with a history of two or more clinical flares, with close monitoring of uric acid levels. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend a target serum urate of less than 6 mg/dL in all subjects, with an even lower target (&lt;5 mg/dL) for patients with more advanced gout. The American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend that the allopurinol starting dose be no greater than 100 mg/day. The dose is gradually escalated by 100 mg daily every 2 to 5 weeks, with serum urate monitoring until the target serum urate is achieved. The maximal U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dose of allopurinol is 800 mg daily.\nIn subjects with advanced chronic kidney disease, the initial dose should be reduced to 50 mg daily, with incre- mental dose escalations of 50 mg. Febuxostat is an alternative urate-lowering therapy and should be used in patients who have failed allopurinol treatment or have demonstrated sensitivity or intolerance to allopurinol. The initial febuxostat dose of 40 mg daily can be increased to 80 mg daily after 2 weeks of therapy if the serum urate target is not achieved.\nPatient who have not attained the target serum urate despite maximal doses of either allopurinol or febuxostat, uricosuric agents (probenecid, up to 2 g daily). Pegloticase (8 mg by IV infusion every 2 weeks) is an intravenously administered monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated recombinant uricase that dramatically lowers serum urate levels. It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of gout in patients for whom conventional therapy has been ineffective.\nBefore the initiation of any form of urate-lowering therapy, the patient should be placed on anti-inflammatory therapy to prevent or minimize the anticipated increase in flare activity that is associated with starting urate-lowering therapy. Background anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is in the form of colchicine once or twice daily or low-dose NSAIDs. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis should be continued until the subject has been free of gout flares for 6 months or longer.\n\n\nTreat to symptoms Approach\nthe 2016 American College of Physicians guideline advocates a “treat-to-symptoms” approach, emphasizing the use of anti-inflammatory medications to control flares and reserving urate-lowering medications for patients with frequent flares. This later approach is not evidence-based.\n\n\n\n\nCalcium Pyrophospate\n\n\nBasic Calcium Arthropathy\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Arthrocentesis Technique\nRead from Robert hedge Procedures",
