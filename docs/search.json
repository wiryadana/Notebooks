I believe my knowledge has been barely enough just to start the program. To compensate my lack in memorizing and attention to detail, I build this books. I published it online but not intended to disseminate widely, at least not yet. It is only to help me doing my work.\nBy the way, this is a Quarto book. Quarto is amazing innovation from Rstudio.org that makes it possible for a lay person creating online books like this one. To learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book made possible by years of clinical education given by all of my teachers."

Mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume (12 ml/kg ideal body weight) traditionally further injured the lung due to repeated alveoli overdistention and stretching. This is called ventilator induced volutrauma and even induce ARDS in patients without ARDS initialy. many studies point toward low tidal volume (6 ml/kg ideal body weight) improve survival.\nreproduce Figure of Preassure volume relathionsip!!!\nProne positioning\nLow CVP or low PCWP or fluid conservatice approach fluid conservative management to maintain low CVP or PCWP associated with fewer days with mechanical ventilation than fluid liberal approach in patients that who have been resuscitated from shock.\n\n\n\n\nType 2 Respiratory Failure: Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure\nIt is a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation and the results from inability to eliminate CO2 effectively. The cause categorized into:\n\nimpaired CNS drive to breathe (“wont breathe”) Cause: drug overdose, brainstem injury, sleep-disordered breathing, severe hypothyroidism\nreduced strength or impaired neuromuscular function in respiratory systems (“cant breathe”) cause: impaired neuromuscular transmission (eg. myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or respiratory muscle weakness (eg. myopathy, electrolye problem, fatigue)\nincreased load on respiratory system (“cant breathe”) cause:\n\nincreased resistive load eg. brochospasm\nreduced lung compliance eg. alveolar edema, atelectasis, intrinsip PEEP\nreduced chest wall compliance eg. pneumothorax, pleural effusion, abdominal distention\nincreased minute ventilation requirements eg. pulmoanry embolus with increased dead space fraction, sepsis\n\n\n\ngeneral Treatment\nPrincipal: reversing the underlying cause(s). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with positive pressure ventilation with tight fitting mask or nasal mask (avoidance of intubation) may stabilize these patients. It tested extensively in exacerbation of COPD. Contraindication for NIV include hemodynamic instability, inability to protect airway, respiratory arrests, significant airway secretions, significant aspiration risk.\n\n\n\nType 3 Respiratory Failure: Lung Atelectasis\nThe primary cause is lung atelectasis. It is common in perioperaticve period, this form is also called perioperative respiratory failure. Post general anesthesia, there are decrease in functional residual capacity lead to collapse of dependent lung units.\n\ngeneral treatment\ntreatment include: frequent positional changes, chest physiotherapy, upright positioning, control of incisional/or abdominal pain.\n\n\n\nType 4 Respiratory Failure: Metabolic Demands\nMost often due to hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles in patients in shock. Normally, respiratory muscle consume < 5% total cardiac outpur (CO) and oxygen delivery. Patients in shock oftern experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (eg. in cardiogenic shock), lactic acidosis and anemia. In these conditions, up to 40% CO distributed to respiratory muscle.\n\nGeneral Treatment\nEndotrachea intubation & mechanical ventilation allow blood redistributed to vital organ and reverse the underlying cause.\n\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation\n\nMaintenance for mechanical Ventilated patients\nRespiratory System Mechanics\nPeak airway pressure dtermined by two variable: airway resistance and respiratory system compliance. At the end of inspiration, there are transient pause of inspiratory flow, the pressure called plateu pressure. Plateu pressure determined by respiratory system compliance. During volume controlled ventilation, the difference peak airway pressure (airway + respiratory system) and plateu pressure (respiratory system) provides a quantitative assesment of airway resistance. Patients with increased airway resistence typically have increased peak airway pressures and abnormally high gradients between peak and plateu airway pressure (> 10 - 15 cmH2O) at a constant inspiratory flow rate of 1 L/s(shown in figure Figure 2.1. Normally, respiratory system compliance is ~ 100 ml/cmH2O, divided by the lungs and chest wall. Pathophysiologic process decrease wall compliance such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax & increase abdominal girth. Lung compliance decreased by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhae, interstitial lung disease, or auto PEEP. Auto-PEEP occurs when there is insufficient time for emptying of alveoli before the next inspiratory cycle, thus alveoli failed to decompress fully and remains positive pressure at all phase of respiration. Theis phenomenon results most commonly from obstruction of distal airways such as Asthma or COPD.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Graph Illustration taken from harrison\n\n\nPatients frequently require sedatives & analgetics.\n\nAnalgesics\nOpieates is the mainstay of mechanicaly ventilated patients\n\n\nSedatives\nAfter pain adequately controlled, sedation needed for anxiolysis, treatment of subjective dyspnea, reduction of autonomic hyperactiviy, reduction of total O2 consumption. Nonbenzodiazepin are preffered because benzodiazepin associated with increased delirium and worse patients outcome.\nAmnesia could be achieved with propofol or benzodiazepine such lorazepam or midazolam.\n\n\nNeuromuscular Blocking Agents\nPatients with ventilatory dyssyncrony despite optimal sedation may needed paralytics agents. Wathout for prolonged weakness, a myopathy known as the postparalytics syndrome. Thus, neuromuscular blocking is the last agent, only in patients which fail to achieve ventilator syncrony with aggresive sedation. Remember, neuromuscular blocking agent do not results in pharmacological paralysis without altering mental status, thus sedative is almost always required for amnesia.\n\n\n\nVentilator Weaning and Extubation\nRecognition of patients readyness to be liberated from mechanical ventilation is important. Screening conducted daily, criteria:\n\nStable oxygenation (Pao2 / Fio2 > 200 and PEEP \\(\\le\\) 5 cm H2O)\nCough and Airway Reflexes Intact\nNo Vasopressor administered\nNo Sedatives adminsitered\n\nif all requirement passed, patient should undergi a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), if sedative still administered, patients could also undergo spontaneous awakening trial (SAT.\nSAT/SBT trial consist of a period of breathing throung endotracheal tube without ventilator support (CPAP 5 cmH2O with or without low-level pressure support and open T-piece breahing system) for 30 - 120 minutes. SBT Failure or should be stopped if:\n\nRR >35 min for >5 min\nO2 saturation <90%\nHR > 140x/min or a 20% increase or decrease from baseline\nSBP <90 mmHg or >180 mmHg\nIncreased anxiety or diaphoresis\n\nif none of these events occured, patients should considered for an extubation trial. Despite these carefull criteria, 10% patients develop respiratory distress after extubation and may require resumption of mechanical ventilation and reintubation.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Multiorgan system failure\nMultiorgan system failure, defined by the simultaneous presence of physiologic dysfunction and/or failure of two or more organs. Organ failure, no matter how it is defined must persist beyond 24 hours.\n\n\n2.1.5 Prevention of Complications in critical ill-patients"
