    "text": "Preface\nIn the middle of 2023, I was so fortunate that I passed the admission for Internal Medicine residency program. I believe my knowledge has been barely enough just to start the program. To compensate my lack in memorizing and attention to detail, I build this books. I published it online but not intended to disseminate widely, at least not yet. It is only to help me doing my work.\nBy the way, this is a Quarto book. Quarto is amazing innovation from Rstudio.org that makes it possible for a lay person creating online books like this one. To learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book made possible by years of clinical education given by all of my teachers."

    "text": "8.2 Shock\n\n8.2.1 Initial Evaluation\nshock is a multisystem end-organ hypoperfusion. The resulting hypoperfusion followed by tissue hypoxia with accompanying lactic acidosis. Clinical Indicator:\n\nReduced MAP\nTachycardia\nTachypnea\nCool Skin and Extremities\nAcute Altered mental Status\nOliguria\n\nReduced MAP could be the product of decreased cardiac output and/or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Thus every shock patients should be evaluated for adequacy of cardiac output. Sign of diminished cardiac output includes (Cold Shock):\n\nA narrow pulse preassure (SBP - DBP), marker of stroke volume\nCool extremities and delayed capillary refill time (COLD SHOCK). Palpate proximal extremities (eg Thigh) rather than distal extremities to determine relative “coolness” as peripheral artery disease may always have cool distal extremities.\n\nContrary, there are sign of increased cardiac output (Warm Shock), that may results from decreased SVR:\n\nA widened pulse pressure (particularly reduced DBP)\nWarm extremities with bounding pulse,\nRapid capillary refill time\n\nIf reduced cardiac output found, then conduct assesment of volume status.\n\nHistory suggesting fluid loss or hemmorhage\nReduced JVP\nStraight leg raise or fluid challange\nUSG Marker: inferior vena cava collapse, left ventricular stroke volume\n\nreduced cardiac function with increased intravascular volume - S3 or S4 gallop - JVP increased - Extremity Edema - Crackles on lung auscultation - Chest Xray show cardiomegaly, widening vascular pedicle, kerley B lines, pulmonary edema. - ECG: ischemic with or withour chest pain.\nIf sign of increased cardiac output found, conduct search for cause of reduced SVR.\n\nSepsis\nLiver Failure\nSevere Pancreatitis\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nBurns\nTrauma\nAnaphylaxis\nThyrotoxicosis\nPeripheral AV shunts\n\nThe need for arterial line and CVC - if shock prolonged and doest resolve with proper fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agent.\nInitial evaluation followed with early aggresive targeted resuscitation improve survival. If initial bedside evaluation yield confounding data, objective assesment with USG/Echo needed.\n\n\n8.2.2 The need for Mechanical Ventilation\nAlways asses the ability of a patient to protect his or her airway and to maintain adequate gas exhange. Early intubation or mechanical ventilation often required for two main reasons:\n\nAcute hypoxemic respiratory failure.\n\nIt may occurs in cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema, septic shock with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nVentilatory failure\n\nOften occurs as a consquence of an increased load on the respiratory system in the form of acute metabolic acidosis or decreased lung compliance.\nAlso in shock, a large percentage of CO need for respiratory muscle (10 folds), lactic acid production from inefficient respiratory muscle activity presents an additional ventilatory load. Ventilatory supports relieve work of breathing and allow redistribution of limited CO to other vital organ.\nSign of respiratory distress:\n\ninability to speak full sentences,\naccessory muscle activity\nparadoxical abdominal muscle activity\nextreme tachypnea (>40 breath/min)\n\nAfter intubation and mechanical ventilation, declines in MAP frequently seen. The reasons:\n\nImpended Venous Return from positive pressure ventilation (PPV)\nreduced endogenous catecholamine secretion once stress associated with respiratory failures abates\nActions of drugs used in endotracheal intubation.\nRight heart failure patients or preexisting pulmonary hypertension, due to increased right ventricula afterload due to PPV.\n\nMany patients may be fluid responsive.Therefore, fluid administration and vasopressor support might needed before intubation."
