### Acid-Base Analysis

Understanding Acid-base analysis is essential for emergency/critical care.[@marino]

#### Basic Concepts of Acid-Base

hydrogen ion concentration is expressed as pH:

$$
pH = Log (1/[H^+]) = - log [H^+]
$$

The physiological range is 7.40, which corresponds to a $[H^+] = 40 nEq/L$

The balance of of hidrogen ions in ECF is determined by partial pressure of CO2 and concentration of bicarbonate. The equation are as follows:

$$
[H^+ = 24 x (PCO_2 / HCO_3)]
$$ The dynamics of $PCO_2 / HCO_3$ identifies the primary acid base disorders and the secondary responses. If the primary changes if the $PCO_2$ then the disturbance if called respiratory acidosis or alkalosis, if the primary forces is the changes in $HCO_3$ then it is metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. If there are primary forces, the the body will reacth with secondary responses to limit the changes in $H^+$. This accomplished by changing the other component of $PCO_2 / HCO_3$ ratio in the same direction. if the primary problem is an increase in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis), the secondary response will involve an increase in HCO3, and this will limit the change in \[H+\] produced by the increase in PaCO2. Secondary responses should not be called "compensatory responses" because they do not completely correct the change in \[H+\] produced by the primary acid-base disorder.[@marino]

##### Metabolic Acidosis

The secondary response to metabolic acidosis is an increase in minute ventilation (tidak volume and respiratory rate) thus resulting in decreased of $PCO_2$. This response appears in 30 - 120 minutes, and can take 12 - 24 hours to complete. The magnitude of the response is defined by the equation:

$$
\Delta PaCO_2 = 1.2 \times \Delta HCO_3
$$ Using the normal PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, a normal HCO3 of 24 mEq/L $$
Expected \ PaCO_2 = 40 - [1.2 times (24 - currect \  HCO_3)]
$$ For a metabolic acidosis with a plasma HCO3 of 14 mEq/L, the ΔHCO3 is 24 -- 14 = 10 mEq/L, the ΔPaCO2 is 1.2 × 10 = 12 mm Hg, and the expected PaCO2 is 40 -- 12 = 28 mm Hg. If the PaCO2 is \> 28 mm Hg, there is a secondary respiratory acidosis. If the PaCO2 is \< 28 mm Hg, there is a secondary respiratory alkalosis.

##### Metabolic Alkalosis

The secondary response to metabolic alkalosis is a decrease in minute ventilation and a subsequent increase in PaCO2.

$$
\Delta PaCO_2 = 0.7 x \Delta HCO_3
$$ Using a normal PaCO2 of 40 mmHg and a normal HCO3 of 24 mEq/L, the above equation can be rewritten as follows:

$$
Expected \ PaCO_2 = 40 + [0.7 times (current \ HCO_3 - 24)] 
$$ For a metabolic alkalosis with a plasma HCO3 of 40 mEq/L, the ΔHCO3 is 40 -- 24 = 16 mEq/L, the ΔPaCO2 is 0.7 × 16 = 11 mm Hg, and the expected PaCO2 is 40 + 11 = 51 mm Hg.

### Liver Function Test

#### General Liver Function

1.  Excretion Functions (Test bilirubin, urobilinogen)
2.  Synthetic Functions (Serum protein, albumin, globuilin, prothrombin,ammonia)
3.  General Metabolic Functions
4.  Storage Site
5.  Hematopoeisis
6.  Catabolism of Steoroid Hormones
7.  Clearence of Exogenous Substances (Bromosulphthalein)

liver has a large amount of anatomical and functional reserve and capacity for rapid regeneration, functional deficiency becomes apparent if there is an extensive liver damage. Test for hepatic Injury (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, 5'-nucleotidase)

**Indication of Liver Function Test:**

1.  Screen for liver disease;
2.  Identify the nature of liver disease (hepatocellular, cholestatic, or infiltrative);
3.  Assess severity and prognosis of liver disease; and
4.  Follow up the course of liver disease

**Limitation Liver Function Test:**

1.  Do not necessarily assess liver function
2.  Lack sensitivity (i.e. may be normal in some liver diseases like cirrhosis)
3.  Lack specificity (i.e. may be abnormal in non-liver disorders e.g. serum albumin is low in nephrotic syndrome and in cirrhosis)

**Non hepatic Cause of Abnormal lver Function Test:** **Increased serum bilirubin:** -- Hemolysis -- Ineffective erythropoiesis -- Resorption of a large hematoma

**Increased aminotransferases:** -- Muscle injury -- Alcohol abuse -- Myocardial infarction

**Increased serum alkaline phosphatase:** -- Pregnancy -- Bone disease

**Low serum albumin:** -- Poor nutritional status -- Proteinuria -- Malabsorption -- Severe illness causing protein catabolism

##### Excretion Function

###### Bilirubin metabolism

Biliruin is mostly (85%) from breakdown of HB of Old red cells in reticuloendothelial cells, mainly in Spleen. Normal serum bilirubin is less than 1 mg/dl. Common method to measure bilirubin are Diazo methods, which measure total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin (thus named an direct bilirubin), while the unconjugated bilirubin were calculated from substraction of total bilirubin - conjugated bilirubin Other derived from premature destruction of red cell precusor in bone marrow. The Steps are following:

![Normal Bilirubin Metabolism](image/bilirubin_normal.png){#bilirubin_normal fig-align="center"}

1.  HB, degraded within macropahes to form heme and globin. Globin consist of amino acids, which are recycled. While Heme (iron + protoporphyrin) release iron, which is stored as ferritin. The protoporphyrin then converted to biliverdin, then to bilirubin.[@PK_2018]

2.  Released bilirubin into the circulation and bind albumin, this called unconjugated bilirubin. It is insoluble to water, but lipid soluble.

3.  Billirubin-albumin complex reaches the liver whee it is taken up by the hepatocytes. Albumin released back to the circulation.

4.  Bilirubin then conjugated with glucoronic acid to form bilirubin monoglucoronid and diglucoronid (conjugated bilirubin). This Process is mediated by the ezyme glucoronyl transferase. Conjugated bilirubin is more soluble in water.

5.  Conjugated bilirubin is secreted from the hepatocytes into biliary canaliculi, from where it passes into the bile duct and gallbladder along with bile.

6.  When bilirubin reaches the large instensites, it is converted to urobilinogen by the baterial enzyme.

7.  Most urobilinogen is excreted in feses as urobilin, thus coloring the feses yellow. A part of urobilinogen is absorbed into the circlation from where it reaches the liver, taken up and reexcreted into the bile. Small amaount of urobilinogen in cleared in urine.

Jaundice or icterus referes to yellow discoloration of skin, screa and mucous membranes due to increased level of serum bilirubin. Jaundice will clinicaly evident when serum bilirubin level exceeds **2.0 mg/dL**.

1.  According to type of dominant bilirubin:

A. Predominant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

If \> 85% of total is unconjugated bilirubin or indirect bilirubin. The cause are hemolysis, ineffective eryhtropoeisus, resorption large hematome, gilbert syndrome.

B. Predominant conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

If \> 50% of total is conjugated or direct bilirubin. Cause are hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholestasis, drugs (anabolic steroid, oral contraceptives), toxin, dubin johnson syndrome, rotor syndrome

C. Mixed (Conjugated and Unconjugated)

if conjugated bilirubin is 20-50% of total, it may results from viral or alcoholic hepatisis.

2.  According to site of disease

![Sites of Cholestasis](image/Site_Cholestasis.png){#sites_cholestasis}

A. Prehepatic There is excessive formation of bilirubin exceeding the capacity of the liver to conjugate it for excretion. The dominant bilirubin is unconjugated. Bilirubin is absent in urine, since of is water insoluble. Urobilinogen is increased in urine and feses. Jaudice is usually mild (total bilirubin usually \< 5.0 mg/dl, conjugated is \< 15% of total). The cuase is usually hematological problem.

B. Hepatic

Both Unconjugated and Conjuated are increased. mainly increased unconjunjugated 1. defective uptake 2. defective conjugation 3. physiologic jaundice (newborn)

mainly Conjugated ilirubin 1. Hepatocellular disease: Liver enzume increase. Biliruibin is around 4.0 s.d 8.0 mg/dl. Conjugated bilirubin is 20-50% of total bilirubin. In hepatocellular injury, both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubins are increased. Unconjugated bilirubin is increased due to reduced ability of liver cells to conjugate bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is raised from cholestasis due to hepatocyte swelling.

2.  Intrahepatic Cholestasis: In intrahepatic cholestasis, there may be (1) impairment of secretion of bilirubin from hepatocytes into the biliary canaliculi; (2) obstruction of bile flow in canaliculi by swollen hepatocytes;or (3) damage to intrahepatic canaliculi.

Drugs commonly associated with cholestatic injury are oral contraceptives, anabolic steroids, oral anti-diabetics, phenothiazines, and erythromycin.

Primary biliary cirrhosis, there is autoimmune destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged, females and is characterized by chronic eleva- tion of alkaline phosphatase and positive anti-mitochondrial antibody in serum.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disorder occurring in young to middle-aged men in whom there is inflammation and destruction of both intrahepatic and extra-hepatic bile ducts. Associated inflammatory bowel disease is often present. Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated and many patients have circulating perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.

C. Post Hepatic

Obstruction of extrahepatic biliary tract prevents flow of bile into the duodenum. This causes "regurgitation" of conjugated bilirubin into the circulation. (Biliary canaliculi distend and rupture due to backpressure of bile and conjugated bilirubin escapes into the sinusoids). Conjugated bilirubin is usually \>50% of total in posthepatic jaundice. Urinary and fecal urobilinogen are decreased, faeces are clay-colored, and bilirubin (being conjugated and water-soluble) appears in urine. Cause of Posthepatic Jaundice:

-   Carcinoma of head of pancreas
-   Carcinoma of ampulla of Vater
-   Secondaries in porta hepatis
-   Gallstones in or stricture of common bile duct

![Three types of Jaundice Differential Diagnosis](image/Types_jaundice.png){#dd_jaundice}

###### Clinial Algorithm of Jaundice
 
Normal serum bilirubin is less than 1 mg/dl. conjugated bilirubin is 10% or less, while unconjugated bilirubin is 90% or more. This is because conjugated bilirubin is rapidly secreted into the bile after its formation and removed through the gut. Conjugated bilirubin is composed of blirubin glucuronide, bilirubin diglucuronide, and delta (δ) bilirubin. Delta bilirubin represents bilirubin covalently bound to albumin in circulation. Normally, δ bilirubin is absent or present in very small amount. In cholestasis, proportion of δ-bilirubin increases. Owing to its longer half-life, it is cleared slowly from circulation. Conjugated bilirubin is weakly bound to albumin, is water-soluble, and can be excreted in urine. Unconjugated bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin and is water-insoluble.

![Jaundice Algorithm](image/jaundice_algorithm.png){#jaundice_algorithm}

##### Synthetic Function

Markers of hepatic synthetic function are serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). Hypoalbuminemia and a prolonged PT indicate a severe functional impairment of liver. 

###### Protein Synthetic

Liver is the sole organ to synthesisze plasma protein, except gamma globulin which synthesized by Plasma Cell. Normal total serum protein in adults is about 5.5 - 8.0 gm / dl, albumin 3.5 - 5.0 which comprise the 60% of serum protein. 

Test for protein in liver disease incldue total serum protein, serum albumin, calculation of albumin/globulin rtio (normal > 1.5) and serum electrophoresis.the common laboratory method to measure total protein is biuret and refractometer method. 

Total serum protein level is affected by both  and gamma globulins. In cirrhosis, decrease in albumin level is often compensated by increase in the level of gamma globulins; therefore, estimation of total serum proteins is of limited value in cirrhosis. Estimation of serum albumin and serum protein electrophoresis are
more helpful.

Albumin is synthesized exclusively in liver and constitutes about 60% of total proteins in 
serum; therefore its estimation is an important investigation in liver disease. Half-life of albumin is about 20 days and therefore fall in its level in response to decreased synthesis is not immediately apparent. Therefore, in acute liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis), there is little change in albumin level. Serum albumin level is low in chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) and correlates with synthetic capacity of hepatocytes; therefore, it is helpful in following progression of cirrhosis. Also, fall in serum
albumin level correlates with severity of ascites. In cirrhosis and in chronic active hepatitis, serum gamma
globulins are increased due to inflammation. Low albumin and raised gamma globulins in serum cause 
reversal of albumin/globulin ratio. Serum albumin is estimated by bromocresol green method

Causes of decreased serum albumin:
• Decreased intake: malnutrition.
• Decreased absorption: malabsorption syndromes.
• Decreased synthesis: liver disease, chronic infections.
• Increased catabolism: thyrotoxicosis, fever, malignancy, infections.
• Increased loss: nephrotic syndrome, severe burns, protein-losing enteropathies, ascites
• Increased blood volume: pregnancy, congestive cardiac failure.

Serum Protein Elektrophoresis:
1. In cirrhosis, albumin may be reduced and there may be polyclonal increase of IgG and IgA, with β-γ
bridging. (IgA migrates between β and γ regions which obscures the demarcation between β and γ peaks).
2. In primary biliary cirrhosis, there is polyclonal increase of IgM.
3. In α1-antitrypsin deficiency (associated with cirrhosis) α1- globulin band is reduced.
4. In chronic active hepatitis, IgG is elevated.

![Serum Protein Electrophoresis patterns and densitometer scans in Normal, Cirhosis and Alpha 1 antitripsin deficienct individuals](image/spe.png){#spe}

###### Prothorombin Time (PT)

Most of the coagulation protein are synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K is required for the synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X by the hepatocytes, thus it is called vitamin K dependent factors. 
Synthesis of the factors is deficient in hepatocellular disease. In Addition, in obstructive jaundice, vitamin K (a fat soluble vitamin) cannot be absorbed due to the absence of bile in the intentine. 

PT measures three out of four vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, and X) and is prolonged in hepatocellular
disease and in obstructive jaundice. Intramuscular injection of vitamin K corrects prolonged PT in obstructive jaundice but not in hepatocellular jaundice. To distinguish between a prolonged PT due to hepato-
cellular disease from that due to cholestasis with fat malabsorption, PT is repeated after administration of
vitamin K. Reduction of prolonged PT occurs in cholestatic liver disease, but not in hepatocellular disease. In acute fulminant liver failure, marked prolongation of PT is an unfavourable prognostic sign.

###### Blood Ammonia 

Blood ammonia is mainly derived from GI tract. In the gut, bacterial enzyme act on nitrogen-containing foods to produce ammonia, which is carried to the liver via portal vein. In the liver, ammonia is converted to non -toxic urea in urea cycle. 

Increased blood ammonia seen in:
- Fulminant hepatic failure
- cirrhosis
- Reye's Syndrome
- "Shunting" of portal blood to systemic circulation
- Gastrointestinal hemmorhage (there is increased of production of ammonia from blood proteins by bacterial enzymes). In hepatic disease, gastrointestinal hemmorhage is associated with increased risk of hepatic encepalopathy.
- Inherited deficiensys of ure cycle enzymes.

If the ammonia is inreased, it might helful indicates a hepatic encepalopathy.

##### Test Hepatocellular Injury

Serum enzyme changes in liver disease result from hepatocyte damage and do not indicate hepatic
functional capacity.

- Serum aspartate aminotransferase or AST (formerly called serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase or SGOT)
- Serum alanine aminotransferase or ALT (formerly called serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or SGPT)
- Serum alkaline phosphatase or ALP 
- γ-Glutamyl transferase or GGT (also called as - γ-glutamyl transpeptidase)
- 5’-nucleotidase (5’-NT)

###### Serum Aminotransferase (Transaminitis)

Both AST and ALT are sensitive marker of hepatocellular injury. ALT is cytosolic enzyme, AST is cytosolic and mitochondria. Normally, aminotransferases are present in serum at a low level. When necrosis or death of cells containing these enzymes occurs, aminotransferases are released into the blood and their concentration in blood increases. This level correlates with extent of tissue damage.

**"Most marked elevations of ALT and AST (>15 times normal) are seen in acute viral hepatitis, toxin-induced
hepatocellular damage (e.g. carbon tetrachloride), and centrilobular necrosis due to ischemia (congestive
cardiac failure)."**

Moderate elevation (5-15X normal) occurs due to chronic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, acute biliary tract obstruction, and drug induced hepatitis.
Mild elevation (1-3 x normal) seen in cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatosis and cholestasis. 

Normal ratio AST/ALT is 0.7 to 1.4. Increased ratio (>2.0) is highly suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis, while ratio <1.0 is seen in acute viral hepatitis. ALT and AST are elevated in acute viral hepatitis even before the appearance of jaundice. Persistence of elevated ALT and AST beyond 6 months in a case of hepatitis indicates development of chronic hepatitis. Measurement of ALP is helpful in differentiation of hepatocellular jaundice from cholestatic jaundice.

###### Serum Alkaline Phospatase (ALP)

Alkaline phosphatase is distributed widely in various tissues like liver, bones, intestine, kidney, and placenta.
In the liver, ALP, GGT, and 5’-NT are located normally on canalicular surface of hepatocytes. In cholestasis, accumulated bile acids dissolve canalicular side of hepatocyte membrane and enzymes are released in blood. Therefore, diseases that affect mainly hepatocyte secretion have elevated levels of ALP.

ALP is increased in most cases of cholestatic type of jaundice. While hepatocellular injury is characterized by marked elevation of ALT and AST, cholestasis is characterized by marked increase (more than 3 times normal) of ALP. Since
there are many other sources of ALP apart from liver, simultaneous measurement of serum GGT and serum 5’-NT may be used to ascertain whether increase of ALP is of hepatic origin. Main cause of increased ALP due to hepatobiliary disease are: Bile duct obstruction, primary biliarry cirhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, infilstrative diseae of liver. 

Disease of bones also could cause increased ALP. ALP present within osteoblasts, thus ALP increase when there is an increase osteoblastic activity. Pregnancy also increase ALP due to increased secretion from plancenta. 

###### Serum Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)

GGT presents in liver, pancreas, kidney, and prostate. The estimation of this enzyme is particularly useful in following: alcoholism (acute alcoholic hepatitis); Cholestasis (elevation of ALP and GGT significantly points toward liver disease); recovery from acute hepatitis (GGT is the last enzyme to return to normal, thus its normalization indicative favourable outcome)

#### Interpretation of Liver Function Test

Liver disease could broadly classified into two: hepatocellular and cholestasis.

**1. Typical LFT profile in hepatocellular disease**

• Marked elevation of AST and ALT (usually >500 IU)

• Mild increase of ALP (<3 times normal)

• Hyperbilirubinemia, if present, is of both conjugated and unconjugated type

• Chronic hepatocellular injury, aminotransferases are moderately elevated, and serum albumin is reduced.

If the LFT showed a hepatocellular disease, then next investigation is to detect underlying cause:

- Viral serology (viral hepatitis: IgM anti-hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis surface B antigen (HBsAg), antihepatitis C antibody),
- search for injurious drugs, toxins or alcohol,
- autoantibodies like antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (autoimmune hepatitis), and serum ceruloplasmin (Wilson disease). 

![History of Jaundice of nonspecific acute illness in the setting of increased aminotransferase](image/hepatocellular_injury.png){#hepatocellular_injury}

If cause is not detected in the presence of persistent elevation of aminotransferases, liver biopsy is performed (that may reveal chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, Wilson disease, haemochromatosis, and infiltrative diseases)

**2. Typical LFT profile in cholestatic jaundice**

• Marked elevation of ALP (>3 times normal)

• Elevation of GGT and 5’-NT

• Mild or no increase of ALT and AST (usually <200 IU)

• Elevation of conjugated bilirubin

• The pattern of elevated ALP but normal serum bilirubin is seen in infiltrative diseases

![Evaluation of Raised ALP in the suspicion of cholestatic injury](image/cholestatic_injury.png){#cholestatic_injury}

In patients with cholestatic or infiltrative pattern of injury, imaging studies should be done for diagnosis of  obstruction. If there is no evidence of obstruction, liver biopsy is usually done

Finally, Severity of liver disease is assessed by serum bilirubin, serum albumin, and prothrombin time. 
Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification is commonly used to assess severity of cirrhosis and is based on both clinical and laboratory parameters
